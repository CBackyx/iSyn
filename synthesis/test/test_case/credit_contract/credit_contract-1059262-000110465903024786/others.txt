The
35
Agent shall, on the date of each demand for payment under any Letter of Credit issued by the Agent, give the Company notice thereof and of the amount of the Company’s reimbursement obligation and liability for expenses relative thereto; provided that the failure of the Agent to give any such notice shall not affect the reimbursement and other obligations of the Company under this Section 3.3.
Such Adjusted Corporate Base Rate Loans shall be deemed disbursed notwithstanding any failure to satisfy any conditions for disbursement of any Revolving Credit Loan and, to the extent of the Adjusted Corporate Base Rate Loans so disbursed, the reimbursement obligation of the Company with respect to such Letter of Credit under this subsection (a)(i) shall be deemed satisfied.
(ii)           If, for any reason (including without limitation as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Company pursuant to subsection 6.1(h)), Adjusted Corporate Base Rate Loans may not be made by the Lenders as described in subsection (a)(i) of this Section 3.3, (A) the Company agrees that each Reimbursement Amount not paid pursuant to the first sentence of subsection (a)(i) of this Section 3.3 shall bear interest, payable on demand by the Agent at the interest rate then applicable to Adjusted Corporate Base Rate Loans, and (B) effective on the date each such Adjusted Corporate Base Rate Loan would otherwise have been made with respect to any Letter of Credit each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment severally agrees that it shall unconditionally and irrevocably, without regard to the occurrence of any Event of Default or Unmatured Event to the extent of such Lender’s pro rata share (based on the percentage of the aggregate Revolving Commitments of all Revolving Lenders then constituted by such Lender’s Revolving Commitment) purchase a participating interest in each Reimbursement Amount.
(iii)          Each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment shall be obligated, absolutely and unconditionally to make Adjusted Corporate Base Rate Loans pursuant to subsection 3.3(a)(i), and to purchase and fund participation interests in Letters of Credit pursuant to subsection 2.4(c) and 3.3(a)(ii), and such obligation shall not be affected by

(ii)           Any amendment, modification, waiver, consent, or any substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any interest in collateral or security, with respect to any of the Letter of Credit Documents;
(iii)          The existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which the Company may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons or entities for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Agent or any Lender or any other Person or entity, whether in connection with any of the Letter of Credit Documents, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or any unrelated transactions;
(iv)          Any draft or other statement or document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
(v)           Payment by the Agent to the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit;

37
party under this Agreement or any of the Letter of Credit Documents, or any other acts or omissions on the part of the Agent, any Lender or any such party; or
(vii)         Any other event or circumstance that would, in the absence of this clause, result in the release or discharge by operation of law or otherwise of the Company from the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Section 3.3.
No setoff, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation or any defense of any kind or nature which the Company has or may have against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit shall be available hereunder to the Company against the Agent or any Lender.
Nothing in this Section 3.3 shall limit the liability, if any, of the Revolving Lenders to the Company pursuant to subsection 3.3(c).
(c)           The Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless the Lenders, the Agent and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which the Lenders, the Agent or any such Person may incur or which may be claimed against any of them by reason of or in connection with any Letter of Credit, and neither any Lender, the Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for:  (i) the use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or for any acts or omissions of any beneficiary in connection therewith; (ii) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (iii) payment by the Agent to the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit; (iv) any error, omission interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit; or (v) any other event or circumstance whatsoever arising in connection with any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to indemnify the Lenders, the Agent and such other Persons, and the Agent and the Revolving Lenders shall be severally liable to the Company to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or incidental, damages suffered by the Company which were caused by (A) the Agent’s wrongful dishonor of any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary thereunder of a draft or other demand for payment and other documentation strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, or (B) the payment by the Agent to the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit to the extent, but only to the extent, that such payment constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent, provided that none of the Agent, any Lender holding a Revolving Commitment or any such Person shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
It is understood that in making any payment under a Letter of Credit the Agent will rely on documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein without further investigation and regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such reliance and payment against documents
38
presented under a Letter of Credit substantially complying with the terms thereof shall not be deemed gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent in connection with such payment.
It is further acknowledged and agreed that the Company may have rights against the beneficiary or others in connection with any Letter of Credit with respect to which the Revolving Lenders or the Agent are alleged to be liable and it shall be a precondition of the assertion of any liability of the Revolving Lenders or the Agent under this Section that the Company shall first have exhausted all remedies in respect of the alleged loss against such beneficiary and any other parties obligated or liable in connection with such Letter of Credit and any related transactions.
The Company hereby authorizes the Agent to charge its account with the Agent in order to cause timely payment of principal, interest and fees due under Section 2.3 to be made (subject to sufficient funds being available in such account for that purpose).
(b)           At the time of making each such payment, the Company shall, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, specify to the Agent that Revolving Credit Advance, portion of the Term Loan, accrued and payable interest, or other obligation of the Company hereunder to which such payment is to be applied.
In the event that the Company fails to so specify the relevant obligation, the Agent may apply such payments to any principal, interest, fees or expenses that are then due and payable as it may determine, or if the Loans shall have become due and payable, the Agent shall apply such payments in accordance with Section 6.3 hereof.
39
All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and other amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be made by the Company without setoff or counterclaim, and free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments, or other charges of whatever nature, imposed by any governmental authority, or by any department, agency or other political subdivision or taxing authority.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever any installment of principal of, or interest on, any Loan or any other amount due hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any installment of principal, interest shall be payable thereon at the rate per annum determined in accordance with this Agreement during such extension.
Computations of interest and other amounts due under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed, including the first day but excluding the last day of the relevant period.
3.7           Additional Costs.
(a)           In the event that on or after the date hereof, the adoption of or any change in any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to any Lender or the Agent, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or the Agent with any guideline, request or directive of any such authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall (i) directly affect the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender or the Agent of any amounts payable by the Company under this Agreement (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of any Lender or the Agent, by the jurisdiction, or by, any political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction, in which any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, has its principal office), or (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by any Lender or the Agent, or (iii) shall impose any other condition with respect to this Agreement, the Commitments, the Notes, the Loans or any Letters of Credit, and the result of any of the foregoing (i.e., (i), (ii) or (iii)) is to increase the cost to any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, of making, funding or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum receivable by any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, thereon, then the Company shall pay to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, from time to time, upon request by such Lender (with a copy of such request to be provided to the Agent) or the Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduced sum receivable to the extent, in the case of any LIBOR Loan, such Lender or the Agent is not compensated therefor in the computation of the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Loan.
A statement as to the amount of such increased cost or reduced sum receivable, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, and submitted by such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, to the Company, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.
40
(b)           In the event that on or after the date hereof, the adoption of or any change in any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to any Lender or the Agent, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or the Agent with any guideline, request or directive of any such authority (whether or not having the force of law), including any risk-based capital guidelines, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or the Agent (or any corporation controlling such Lender or the Agent) and such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender’s or the Agent’s obligations hereunder and such increase has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Agent’s (or such controlling corporation’s) capital as a consequence of such obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or the Agent (or such controlling corporation) could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or the Agent to be material, then the Company shall pay to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, from time to time, upon request by such Lender (with a copy of such request to be provided to the Agent) or the Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or the Agent (or such controlling corporation) for any increase in the amount of capital and reduced rate of return which such Lender or the Agent reasonably determines to be allocable to the existence of such Lender’s or the Agent’s obligations hereunder.
A statement as to the amount of such compensation, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, and submitted by such Lender or the Agent to the Company, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.
3.8           Illegality and Impossibility.
In the event that on or after the date hereof, the adoption of or any change in any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) or any change in any interpretation or administration of any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to any Lender or the Agent, by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any guideline, request or directive or such authority (whether or not having the force of law), including without limitation exchange controls, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to maintain any LIBOR Loan under this Agreement, such Lender’s outstanding LIBOR Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Adjusted Corporate Base Loans on the respective last days of the then current LIBOR Interest Periods with respect to such LIBOR Loans or within such earlier period as required by law.
If any such conversion of a LIBOR Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current LIBOR Interest Period with respect thereto, the Company shall
41
pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.9 as if such conversion were a prepayment.
3.9           Indemnification.
If the Company makes any payment of principal with respect to any LIBOR Loan on any other date than the last day of a LIBOR Interest Period applicable thereto (whether pursuant to Section 3.8, Section 6.2 or otherwise), or if the Company fails to borrow any LIBOR Loan after notice has been given to the Lenders in accordance with Section 2.4, or if the Company fails to make any payment of principal or interest in respect of a LIBOR Loan when due, the Company shall reimburse each Lender on demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by each such Lender, including, without limitation any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, whether or not such Lender shall have funded or committed to fund such Revolving Credit Loan.
A statement as to the amount of such loss or expense, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by such Lender and submitted by such Lender to the Company, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.
Calculation of all amounts payable to such Lender under this Section 3.9 shall be made as though such Lender shall have actually funded or committed to fund the relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase of an underlying deposit in an amount equal to the amount of such Revolving Credit Loan and having a maturity comparable to the related LIBOR Interest Period and through the transfer of such deposit from an offshore office of such Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United States of America; provided, however, that such Lender may fund any LIBOR Loan in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the purpose of calculation of amounts payable under this Section 3.9.
3.10         Substitution of Lender.
If (i) the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 3.8 when not all Lender’s obligations have been suspended, (ii) any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 3.7 or (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Company shall have the right, if no Unmatured Event or Event of Default then exists, to replace such Lender (a “Replaced Lender”) with one or more other lenders (collectively, the “Replacement Lender”) acceptable to the Agent, provided that (x) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 3.10, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Acceptances, pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the Commitments, the outstanding Revolving Credit Advances, the Replaced Lender’s pro rata portion of the outstanding Term Loan and other obligations of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay to the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of (A) the amount of principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, (B) the amount of all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender under Section 2.3 and (C) the amount which would be payable by the Company to the Replaced Lender pursuant to Section 3.9 if the Company prepaid at the time of such replacement all of the Loans of such Replaced Lender outstanding at such time and (y) all obligations of the Company then owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (x) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, deemed paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement.

(c)           Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent and each Lender may, subject to Section 7.10, at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Company (any requirement for such notice being expressly waived by the Company) set off and apply against any and all of the obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, whether owing to such Lender or any other Lender or the Agent, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Agent or such Lender or any Affiliate of the Agent or such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Company and any property of the Company from time to time in possession of the Agent or such Lender, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although
73
such obligations may be contingent and unmatured.
The Company hereby grants to the Lenders and the Agent a lien on and security interest in all such deposits, indebtedness and property as collateral security for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.
The rights of each Lender and the Agent under this subsection 6.2(c) are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which the Agent or each such Lender may have.
6.3           Distribution of Proceeds of Collateral.
All proceeds of any realization on the collateral pursuant to the Security Documents and any payments received by the Agent or any Lender pursuant to the Guaranties after the Loans become due and payable (whether by acceleration or otherwise), shall be allocated and distributed by the Agent as follows:
(a)           First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation all reasonable attorneys’ fees, of the Agent in connection with the enforcement of the Security Documents and otherwise administering this Agreement;
(b)           Second, to the payment of all fees required to be paid under any Loan Document including commitment fees, owing to the Agent and the Revolving Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Lender Indebtedness consisting of fees owing to the Agent and the Revolving Lenders, for application to payment of such liabilities;

(e)           Fifth, to the payment of any and all other amounts owing to the Revolving Lenders and the Agent on a pro rata basis in accordance with the total amount of such Indebtedness owing to each of the Revolving Lenders and the Agent, for application to payment of such liabilities; and
(f)            Sixth, to the payment of all fees required to be paid under any Loan Document, owing to the Lenders holding a portion of the Term Loan on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Lender Indebtedness consisting of fees owing to the Lenders holding a portion of the Term Loan, for application to payment of such liabilities;
(g)           Seventh, to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders holding a portion of the Term Loan on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Lender Indebtedness consisting of interest owing to each of such Lenders holding a portion of the Term Loan, and obligations and liabilities relating to Swaps owing to the Lenders holding a portion of the Term Loan for application to payment of such liabilities;

(i)            Ninth, to the payment of any and all other amounts owing to the Lenders holding a portion of the Term Loan on a pro rata basis in accordance with the total amount of such Indebtedness owing to each of such Lenders, for application to payment of such liabilities; and
(j)            Tenth, to the Company, its Subsidiaries or such other Person as may be legally entitled thereto.
Instead, such payments shall, for so long as such Defaulting Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, be held by the Agent, and the Agent is hereby authorized and directed by all parties hereto to hold such funds in escrow and apply such funds as follows:
(i)            First, if applicable to any payments due from such Defaulting Lender to the Agent, and
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the termination of all Commitments and the payment and performance of all the Loans and other obligations owing to the Agent and the Lenders hereunder (other than those owing to a Defaulting Lender), any funds then held in escrow by the Agent pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be distributed to each Defaulting Lender, pro rata in proportion to amounts that would be due to each Defaulting Lender but for the fact that it is a Defaulting Lender.
6.4           Letter of Credit Liabilities.
For the purposes of payments and distributions under Section 6.3, the full amount of Lender Indebtedness on account of any Letter of Credit then outstanding but not drawn upon shall be deemed to be then due and owing.
Amounts distributable to the Lenders, Agent on account of such Lender Indebtedness under such Letters of Credit shall be deposited in a separate collateral account in the name of and under the control of the Agent and held by the Agent first as security for such Letter of Credit Lender Indebtedness and then as security for all other Lender Indebtedness and the amount so deposited shall be applied to the Letter of Credit Lender Indebtedness at such times and to the extent that such Letter of Credit Lender Indebtedness become absolute liabilities and if and to the extent that the Letter of Credit Lender Indebtedness fails to become absolute Lender Indebtedness because of the expiration or termination of the underlying Letters of Credit without being drawn upon then such amounts shall be applied to the remaining Lender Indebtedness in the order provided in Section 6.3.
The Company hereby grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and Agent,
75
a lien and security interest in all such funds, as security for all the Lender Indebtedness as set forth above.
ARTICLE VII
THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS
7.1           Appointment: Nature of Relationship.
Effective upon the Effective Date, each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes LaSalle as the Agent to act as the contractual representative of each such Lender thereafter with the rights and duties expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.
LaSalle, as the Agent, agrees to act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article VII.
Notwithstanding the use of the defined term “Agent,” it is expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
In its capacity as the Lenders’ contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a “representative” of the Lenders within the meaning of § 9-102 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.
7.2           Powers.
The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.
7.3           General Immunity.
Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
7.4           No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc.
Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any Borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article II, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Agent; (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; or (v) the value,
76
sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any interest in any collateral security.
The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Company or any Subsidiary to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Company or any Subsidiary to the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).
7.5           Action on Instructions of Lenders.
The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Lenders, the Required Lenders, the Required Revolving Lenders or the Required Term Loan Lenders, as the case may be, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders and on all holders of Notes.
The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Lenders, the Required Lenders, the Required Revolving Lenders or the Required Term Loan Lenders, as the case may be.
7.6           Employment of Agents and Counsel.
The Agent may execute any of its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.
The Agent shall be entitled to rely on advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document.
7.7           Reliance on Documents; Counsel.
The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Agent.
7.8           Agent’s Reimbursement and Indemnification.
The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Company for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Company under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence
77
or willful misconduct of the Agent.
The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 7.8 shall survive payment of the Lender Indebtedness and termination of this Agreement.
7.9           Notice of Default.
The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Unmatured Event or Event of Default hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Company referring to this Agreement describing such Event of Default or Unmatured Event and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.
7.10         Rights as a Lender.
In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity.
The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Company or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.
The Agent, in its individual capacity, is not, subject to Section 8.6, obligated to remain a Lender.
7.11         Lender Credit Decision.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Company and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Company and the Lenders, a successor Agent.
If the Agent has resigned and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Company shall make all payments in respect of the Lender Indebtedness to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders.
No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment.
Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $500,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
78
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent.
After the effectiveness of the resignation of an Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
7.13         Collateral Management.
The Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of all of the Lenders, without the necessity of any further consent from any Lender, from time to time prior to an Event of Default, to take any action with respect to the collateral or the Security Documents which may be necessary (i) to perfect and maintain perfected the security interest in and liens upon the collateral granted pursuant to the Security Documents, and (ii) to release portions of the collateral from the security interests and liens imposed by the Security Documents in connection with any dispositions of such portions of the collateral permitted hereby.
In the event that the Company or the Guarantors desire to sell or otherwise dispose of any assets and such sale or disposition is permitted hereby, the Agent shall, upon timely notice from the Company, release such portions of the collateral from the security interests and liens imposed by the Security Documents as may be specified by the Company or the Guarantors in order for the Borrower or the Guarantors to consummate such proposed sale or disposition, provided that at or prior to the time of such proposed sale or disposition no Unmatured Event or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, including, without limitation, any Unmatured Event or Event of Default that would arise upon consummation of such sale or disposition.
7.14         Right to Indemnity.
The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Revolving Credit Advance, the Term Loan or any other obligation owing to any of the Lenders under this Agreement through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker’s lien, counterclaim or otherwise in excess of its ratable share of payments received by all of the Lenders on account of the Revolving Credit Advances, the Term Loan and other obligations, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders participations in such Revolving Credit Advances, the Term Loan and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all of the Lenders share such payment in accordance with such ratable shares, except as otherwise required by Section 6.3.
The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker’s lien, counterclaim or otherwise as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender, which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of
79
participations theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Company agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including set-off, banker’s lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Revolving Credit Advance, the Term Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation.
It is further understood and agreed among the Lenders and the Agent that if the Agent shall engage in any other transactions with the Company and shall have the benefit of any collateral or security therefor which does not expressly secure the obligations arising under this Agreement except by virtue of a so-called dragnet clause or comparable provision, the Agent shall be entitled to apply any proceeds of such collateral or security first in respect of the obligations arising in connection with such other transaction before application to the obligations arising under this Agreement.
7.16         Withholding Tax Exemption.

(vi)          and if and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.
The Company shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for all Indemnified Liabilities subject to and pursuant to the foregoing provisions, regardless of whether the Company or any of its Subsidiaries had knowledge of the facts and circumstances giving rise to such Indemnified Liability; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
8.6           Successors and Assigns.
(a)           This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided that the Company may not, without the prior consent of all the Lenders, assign its rights or obligations under any Loan Document and the Lenders shall not be obligated to make any Loan hereunder to any entity other than the Company.
(b)           Any Lender may sell a participation interest to any financial institution or institutions, and such financial institution or institutions may further sell a participation interest (undivided or divided) in, the Loans and such Lender’s rights and benefits under the Loan Documents, and to the extent of that participation, such participant or participants shall have the same rights and benefits against the Company under subsection 6.2(c) as it or they would have had if participation of such participant or participants were the Lender making the Loans to the Company hereunder, provided, however, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unmodified and fully effective and enforceable against such Lender, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of its Notes for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Company, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) such Lender shall not grant to its participant any rights to consent or withhold consent to any action taken by such Lender or the Agent under this Agreement other than action requiring the consent of all of the Lenders hereunder (or in the case of a participation in the Revolving Credit Loans and Revolving Commitments, the consent of all Revolving Lenders hereunder), and (iv) such participation shall in no event be less than $5,000,000.
The Agent from time to time in its sole discretion may appoint agents for the purpose of servicing and administering this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and enforcing or exercising any rights or remedies of the Agent provided under the Loan Documents or otherwise.
86
The Company hereby consents to the appointment of such agent and agrees to provide all such notices, reports and other documents and to otherwise deal with such agent acting on behalf of the Agent in the same manner as would be required if dealing with the Agent itself.
(c)           Each Lender may, with the prior written consent of the Company solely as to the Revolving Credit Advances and Revolving Commitments, which consent from the Company shall not be unreasonably withheld and may not be withheld if any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or if such assignment is to an Affiliate of a Lender or to another Lender, and the prior written consent of the Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Revolving Credit Advances and pro rata portion of the Term Loan owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations, (ii) except in the case of an assignment of all of a Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, unless such assignment is to another Lender, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $2,500,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 thereafter, or such lesser amount as the Company and the Agent may consent to, and (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit J hereto (an “Assignment and Acceptance”), together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, payable to the Agent for its sole benefit.
Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).
(d)           By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Company or the performance or observance by the
87
Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document famished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.6 and subsection 5.1(d) for periods prior to the date of such assignment, and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement and such Assignment and Acceptance are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding, for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Company, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.
Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the applicable exhibit(s) hereto.
(g)           The Lenders may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 8.6, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Company,
88
provided that assignee or participant agrees to keep all non-public information confidential to the same extent required by this Agreement.
(h)           Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or assign, all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Lender in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; provided that such creation of a security interest or assignment shall not release such Lender from its obligations under this Agreement.
8.7           Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.
8.8           Governing Law.
This Agreement is a contract made under, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of Illinois in the same manner applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State and without giving effect to choice of law principles of such State.
8.9           Table of Contents and Headings.
The table of contents and the headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for the convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.
8.10         Construction of Certain Provisions.
If any provision of this Agreement refers to any action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person, whether or not expressly specified in such provision.
8.11         Integration and Severability.
This Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit Agreement and embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and the Agent and the Lenders, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter hereof.
In case any one or more of the obligations of the Company under any Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining obligations of the Company shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in one jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the obligations of the Company under any Loan Document in any other jurisdiction.
8.12         Independence of Covenants.
All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any such covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Unmatured Event or an Event of Default or any event or condition which with notice or lapse of time, or both, could become such an Unmatured Event or an Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.
89
8.13         Interest Rate Limitation.
Notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document, in no event shall the amount of interest paid or agreed to be paid by the Company exceed an amount computed at the highest rate of interest permissible under applicable law.
If, from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of any Loan Document at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the interest rate limitation validly prescribed by law which a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then, ipso facto, the obligations to be fulfilled shall be reduced to an amount computed at the highest rate of interest permissible under applicable law, and if for any reason whatsoever the Lender shall ever receive as interest an amount which would be deemed unlawful under such applicable law such interest shall be automatically applied to the payment of principal of the Loans outstanding hereunder to such Lender (whether or not then due and payable) and not to the payment of interest, or shall be refunded to the Company if such principal and all other obligations of the Company to the Lenders have been paid in full.
(a)           If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder by the Company in one currency into another currency, the Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the relevant Lender could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the final judgment is given.
(b)           The obligations of the Company in respect of any sum due in Dollars to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the “Applicable Creditor”) shall, notwithstanding any payment obligation or judgment in a currency (the “Payment Currency”) other than Dollars, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Payment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase Dollars with the Payment Currency; if the amount of Dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in Dollars, the Company agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss.
The obligations of the Company contained in this Section 8.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.
The Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:
(a)           submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of any United States federal or Illinois state court sitting in Chicago, Illinois and appellate courts from any thereof;
90
(b)           consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives an objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;
(d)           agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and
(e)           waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
8.16         Acknowledgments.
The Company hereby acknowledges that:
(a)           it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
(b)           none of the Agent or any Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Company arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Agent and the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and
(c)           no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Company and the Lenders.
8.17         Confidentiality.
Each Lender agrees to hold any non-public confidential information which it may receive from the Company pursuant to this Agreement in confidence except for disclosure: (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and their respective Affiliates, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other professional advisors to that Lender or to a potential participant or assignee, (iii) to regulatory officials, (iv) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required by law, regulation, or legal process, (v) to any Person in connection with any legal proceeding to which that Lender is a party, and (vi) otherwise permitted by this Agreement.
THE LENDERS AND THE AGENT AND THE COMPANY, AFTER CONSULTING OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
91
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY OF THEM.
NEITHER ANY LENDER, THE AGENT NOR THE COMPANY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE, BY COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHERWISE, ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED.
THESE PROVISIONS SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN ANY RESPECT OR RELINQUISHED BY ANY PARTY HERETO EXCEPT BY A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT EXECUTED BY SUCH PARTY.
8.19         Amendment and Restatement.
Upon the satisfaction or waiver (in the discretion of the Agent and the Lenders) of all the conditions set forth in Section 2.5, the Existing Credit Agreement automatically shall be deemed amended and restated in its entirety by this Credit Agreement (it being understood that until such satisfaction or waiver, the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement shall continue in full force and effect).
It is the intent of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall re-evidence, in part, the Lender Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement and is in no way intended to constitute a novation of any of the Lender Indebtedness which was evidenced by the Existing Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed in connection therewith.
