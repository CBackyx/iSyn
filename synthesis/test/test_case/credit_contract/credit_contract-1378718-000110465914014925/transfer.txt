Each Non-US Lender shall (i) promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the United States taxing authorities for such purpose) and (ii) take such steps as shall not be disadvantageous to it, in its reasonable judgment, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its lending office pursuant to Section 2.23) to avoid any requirement of applicable laws of any such jurisdiction that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
(e)                                  Each Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) (a “US Lender”) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two accurate and complete originals of IRS Form W-9, or any subsequent versions or successors to such form.
