On each anniversary of the Effective Date or such other appropriate date during each year of the Term when the salaries of executives at the Executive’s level are normally reviewed, the Company shall review the Base Salary and determine if, and by how much, the Base Salary should be increased; provided, however, the Base Salary under this Agreement, including as subsequently adjusted upwards, may not be decreased thereafter without the written consent of Executive, except for across-the-board changes for executives at the Executive’s level.
All payments of Base Salary or other compensation hereunder shall be less such deductions or withholdings as are required by applicable law and regulations.

The Executive shall be eligible for an annual cash incentive bonus at a target opportunity of seventy percent (70%) of Base Salary (up to a maximum opportunity of one hundred forty percent (140%) of Base Salary) based upon the achievement of certain business unit objectives established in advance by the Company and/or the Committee (the “Annual Bonus”).
The actual amount of any Annual Bonus shall be determined by and in accordance with the terms of the Company’s then-current Bonus Program and the Executive shall have no absolute right to an Annual Bonus in any year.

For purposes of this Agreement, a “Recent Annual Bonus” shall mean a prior year’s Annual Bonus in cash equal to at least the highest “annual short-term incentive award” (as such terminology is defined in the Foster Wheeler Annual Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan) received by the Executive under the Foster Wheeler Annual Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan, or any comparable bonus under any predecessor or successor plan, including any bonus or portion thereof that has been awarded but deferred, for the last three full fiscal years prior to the Start Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that during any three year look-back period above, any annual bonus paid and received by Executive under the Foster Wheeler Annual Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (or any respective predecessor annual incentive plan) was paid by a Foster Wheeler affiliate other than the Company, then any such annual bonus paid by either the Company or any other Foster Wheeler affiliate during the three-year look-back period shall be deemed to be paid by the Company for purposes of this computation.

three (3) payments, the first two each in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Executive’s annual cash incentive bonus payment at target, and the third in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Executive’s annual cash incentive bonus payment at target, the first and second of such payments being payable in each of the first and second years following the Termination Date at the same time that the Company pays annual cash incentive bonuses to its active employees pursuant to its then current Bonus Program (or, if no payment to its active employees is made in the relevant year, at the time that such bonuses normally would be scheduled to be paid) and the third being payable at the same time in the third year following the Termination Date;

the Company shall make a cash payment each month during the thirty (30) month period commencing after the Executive’s Termination Date, equal to the full monthly premium for the medical and health benefits described in Section 4.3.2(v) above minus the active employee cost of such coverage, such amount to be grossed-up for any applicable income taxes;
the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, in an amount not to exceed $8,000.00 in the aggregate (which amount includes any applicable gross-up for any taxes, other than Excise Taxes as defined in Section 4.3.6 below, due for such payment), provide the Executive with outplacement services the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in the Executive’s sole discretion; and
The Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive’s estate or beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Termination Date.
The Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Termination Date.
Such Annual Base Salary
and compensation previously deferred shall be shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Termination Date.
A “Payment” shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a “Gross-Up Payment”) in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
Any Gross-Up Payment will be made as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the Excise Tax is incurred.
Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Subsection 4.3.6, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm’s determination.
As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (“Underpayment”), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.
The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).
If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company’s complying with the requirements of paragraph (iv)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).
As soon as technically possible following the Start Date, the Executive shall receive an immediate payment in cash of the Annual Bonus under the Foster Wheeler Annual Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan, or any successor plan, for the year in which the Change of Control takes place equal to the Annual Bonus the Executive received (if any) for the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the Change of Control took place.
If it is determined, after the end of the year in which the Change of Control took place, that the amount of the Annual Bonus that is actually due to the Executive for such year under the Foster Wheeler Annual Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan, or any successor plan, exceeds the amount paid pursuant to the preceding sentence, the excess shall be paid to the Executive no later than the fifteenth day of the third month of the fiscal year next following the fiscal year for which this Annual Bonus is paid under this Section 4.3.7.
It is expressly agreed that the overall Annual Bonus paid for the year in which the Change of Control takes place in no event shall be lower than the Recent Annual Bonus.
Accordingly, the Executive agrees:
For purposes of this Agreement, “a material line of business conducted by the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company” means an activity of the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company generating gross revenues to the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company of more than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) in the immediately preceding fiscal year of the Company.
The Company agrees to pay as incurred (within ten days following the Company’s receipt of an invoice from the Executive, which invoice the Executive must submit to the Company not later than March 1 of the year following the year in which the expenses were incurred), to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.
The arbitrator shall have the discretion to award reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses to the prevailing party.
