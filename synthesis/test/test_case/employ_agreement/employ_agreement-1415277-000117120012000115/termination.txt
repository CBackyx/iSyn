(b)               Beginning on the date of this Agreement, the Employment Period shall automatically be extended for one (1) additional day each day, unless either the Company and the Bank, acting jointly, or the Executive elects not to extend the Agreement further by giving written notice to the other parties, in which case the Employment Period shall end on the third anniversary of the date on which such written notice is given.

(c)                Subject to Section 3, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Bank from terminating the Executive’s employment at any time during the Employment Period with or without notice for any reason; provided, however, that the relative rights and obligations of the Company, the Bank and the Executive in the event of any such termination shall be determined under this Agreement.Section 3.
In the event that the period for which the Cash Incentive Compensation payable to the Executive is less than a full fiscal quarter (e.g., where the effective date of termination of this Agreement is not as of the end of a quarter), the amount of Cash Incentive Compensation payable to the Executive shall be calculated by multiplying the Cash Incentive Compensation to which the Executive would have been entitled for such fiscal quarter (had he been employed for the entire quarter) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during such fiscal quarter up to and including the effective date of termination, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such fiscal quarter.
Any options issued under this provision on or after January 1, 2007 shall be granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value (as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”)) of the underlying shares of common stock and shall vest and become exercisable in five (5) equal increments on the 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 month anniversaries after the date of grant; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision in the Agreement to the contrary, in the event (i) the Executive is terminated by the Company not for “cause” as defined in Section 10(a)(i) of the Agreement, (ii) of a Change of Control, (iii) of the death of the Executive, or (iv) of the Disability of the Executive, then any unvested outstanding options granted under this provision upon the date of one of these events shall become immediately vested and exercisable upon such date.

(d)               During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to six (6) weeks (thirty business days) of vacation in each calendar year, and shall be compensated with respect thereto in accordance with the Company’s and the Bank’s normal vacation policies.
(e)                The Company or the Bank shall own and pay the costs of premiums on guaranteed renewable straight term life insurance insuring the life of the Executive in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) two (2) times the Executive’s base salary or (ii) $125,000.00, and the Company or Bank shall designate the beneficiary of such policy as such person or persons named by the Executive from time to time.
(g)               In addition to reimbursements for memberships described in Section 8, the Company and/or the Bank shall reimburse the Executive for the costs associated with one (1) country club membership and one (1) dining club membership of the Executive’s choosing.

(i)                 Beginning with the filing of the Company's Form 10-K with the SEC in 2012, and annually thereafter during the Employment Period based on each of the Company's Forms 10-K filed annually thereafter during the Employment Period, the Executive shall be granted by the Company, within thirty (30) days of the filing of each such Form 10-K and pursuant to the terms as contained in restricted stock grant agreements, restricted stock grants to the extent earned based on the criteria set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto and made a part hereof, with the total maximum annual fair market value of such grants equaling fifty percent (50%) of the Highest Executive Salary for the fiscal year in question (i.e., the fiscal year which is the subject of such Form 10-K).
Any grants issued under this provision shall vest in ten (10) equal annual increments (provided, however, that all such restricted stock shall become immediately vested in the event (i) the Executive is terminated by the Company not for "cause" as defined in Section 10(a)(i) of this Agreement, (ii) of a Change of Control, (iii) of the death of the Executive, or (iv) of the Disability of the Executive), and the number of shares granted with respect to any year shall be calculated by determining the portion of the opportunity dollar amount earned in accordance with Exhibit C divided by the fair market value (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) of one share of the Company's common stock as of the close of business on the last business day of February in the calendar year immediately following the fiscal year in question (provided, however, that if the Company's Form 10-K is not yet filed with the SEC as of such last business day, then the valuation date shall be the seventh (7th) day after the date on which such Form 10-K is filed by the Company with the SEC).

(a)                The Executive may serve as a member of the boards of directors of such business, community and charitable organizations as he may disclose to and as may be approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or the Bank (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that any such service shall not materially interfere with the performance of his duties under this Agreement.
(b)               If the Executive is discharged or suspended, or is subject to any regulatory prohibition or restriction with respect to participation in the affairs of the Bank, he shall (subject to the Company’s powers of termination hereunder) continue to perform services for the Company in accordance with this Agreement but shall not directly or indirectly provide services to or participate in the affairs of the Bank in a manner inconsistent with the terms of such discharge or suspension or any applicable regulatory order.

(b)               Upon the termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company and/or the Bank prior to a Change of Control under any of the events set forth in Sections 9(a)(i) or (ii) during the Employment Period, or upon a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), the Company and/or the Bank (jointly and/or severally) shall pay and provide to the Executive (or, upon death then to the Executive’s estate) the following Severance Benefits:(i)                 The Executive’s earned but unpaid Cash Compensation (as determined pursuant to Section 4) in effect as of the applicable Triggering Event Date (as defined below), such payment to be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by law applicable to the payment of wages but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the applicable Triggering Event Date (provided that if the Executive has made an irrevocable election under any deferred compensation arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code to defer any portion of such Cash Compensation, the terms of the applicable arrangement shall apply to distribution of such portion); and

Such benefits shall be determined separately for each such Employee Pension Benefit Plan in effect as of the termination date; over(B)              The present value of the accrued benefits to which the Executive is actually entitled under each such Employee Pension Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit plan as of the Triggering Event Date using comparable actuarial assumptions (where applicable) as then being utilized by such respective plan.
In computing the present value of such lump sum payment, the annualized rate of interest prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for the computation of the value of lump sum payments otherwise payable under terminating single employer defined benefit plans for the month in which the Executive’s termination of employment occurs (“Applicable PBGC Rate”) shall be utilized; and

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(b), (x) in the event that the Executive is a Specified Employee (as defined in the SERP) as of the date of termination of employment, amounts payable under Sections 9(b)(iii-v) due to a qualifying termination of employment that constitute a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following the date of termination of employment shall instead be paid, with interest on any delayed payment at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code determined as of the date of termination of employment, on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Executive’s date of termination of employment (the “Delayed Payment Date”), and (y) in the event that amounts are payable under Sections 9(b)(iii)-(v) due to a Change of Control but such Change of Control does not constitute a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or the Bank, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company or the Bank (as defined in Section 409A of the Code and regulations thereunder), such amounts shall instead be paid, with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code determined as of the date of the Change of Control, on the first to occur of the Executive’s termination of employment (or, if the Executive is a Specified Employee on such date, the Delayed Payment Date) or a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or the Bank, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company or the Bank (each as defined in Section 409A of the Code and regulations thereunder).
(c)                Upon the termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company and/or the Bank under any of the events set forth in Sections 9(a)(i), 9(a)(ii), 10(a)(iii) or 10(a)(iv) during the Employment Period, or upon a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) (including under terminations referred to in Section 11(c) hereof), any options to purchase the Company’s stock and any restricted stock grants granted to the Executive by the Company shall immediately vest, and such options may be exercised in accordance with the terms of such option grants at any time on or prior to their original expiration date.
(d)               The parties shall take all steps necessary (including with regard to any post-termination services by the Executive) to ensure that the date of any termination of employment hereunder constitutes a “Separation from Service” (as defined in the SERP).Section 10.

(c)                For purposes of Section 10(a)(i), no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered “intentional” or “willful” unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive’s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company and the Bank.
