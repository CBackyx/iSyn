(3)                                 if the Stock Price is less than $8.85 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment (the “Make Whole Floor”), no Change in Control Event Shares or Redemption Notice Event Shares will be issued upon exchange.
(a)                                 If the Parent Guarantor issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock, or if the Parent Guarantor effects a share split or share combination, the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(b)                                 If the Parent Guarantor issues to all holders of Common Stock any rights, warrants, options or other securities entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of issuance thereof to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock within 45 days after the issuance thereof, in either case at an exercise price per share of Common Stock or a conversion price per share less than the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the time of announcement of such issuance, the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula (provided that the
ER1 = ER0 × (OS0 + X)/(OS0 + Y)
ER0 = the Exchange Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance;
OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance;
Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of (A) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities and (B) the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.
ER1 = ER0 × SP0/(SP0 – FMV)
ER0 = the Exchange Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
ER1 = the Exchange Rate in effect on and immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
SP0 = the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; and
ER1 = ER0 × (FMV0 + MP0)/MP0
FMV0 = the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading Days after the effective date of the Spin-Off; and
MP0 = the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading Days after the effective date of the Spin-Off.
(d)                                 If following the date of original issuance of the Securities, the Parent Guarantor makes any cash dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock in aggregate amount that, together with other cash dividends or distributions during such quarterly fiscal period, on a per share basis, exceeds $0.19 (the “Reference Dividend”) the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
ER1 = ER0 × SP0 /(SP0 – C)
ER0 = the Exchange Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
ER1 = the Exchange Rate in effect on and immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
SP0 = the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the period of the 10 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; and
C = the amount in cash per share that the Parent Guarantor distributes to holders of Common Stock during such quarterly fiscal period in excess of the Reference Dividend.
(e)                                  If the Parent Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Closing Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (the “Expiration Time”), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
ER1 = ER0 × (AC + (SP1 × OS1))/(SP1 × OS0)
SP1 = the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender offer or exchange offer expires.
(6)                                 as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of less than 100 shares of Common Stock; and
All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/1000th of a share, as the case may be.
The initial Exchange Rate for the Securities is 102.7221 shares of Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of the Securities, subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 4.03 and 4.04 (herein called the “Exchange Rate”).
Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares.
If any fractional share of Common Stock would be issuable upon the exchange of any Security or Securities, the Issuer shall make an adjustment and payment therefor in cash to the Holder of Securities at a price
equal to the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the Applicable Exchange Measurement Period.

If the Issuer elects to satisfy a portion of the Exchange Obligation in cash (expressed either as a dollar amount or as a percentage of the Daily Exchange Value, each, the “Partial Cash Amount”) and a portion in shares of Common Stock, then the Issuer shall deliver, for each Trading Day in the Applicable Exchange Measurement Period, (A) the lesser of (x) such Partial Cash Amount divided by 20 or, if expressed as a percentage of the Exchange Obligation, such Partial Cash Amount will be calculated as a percentage of the Daily Exchange Value (the “Daily Partial Cash Amount”) and (y) the Daily Exchange Value, plus (B) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (x) the excess, if any, of the Daily Exchange Value over such Daily Partial Cash Amount divided by (y) the Closing Sales Price of the Common Stock for such day.
Payment of Securities.
Any payment hereunder shall be considered paid on the applicable date due if on such date the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with this Indenture, money sufficient to pay all such amounts then due.
The Issuer shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, pay interest in immediately available funds on overdue principal amount and interest at the annual rate borne by the Securities compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for.
All such overdue interest shall be payable on demand.
Money for Securities Payments to be Held in Trust.
(1)                                 the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

If the Issuer so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated interest payable on the Securities.
In the event the Issuer does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
In order to elect to pay the additional interest as the sole remedy during the first 60 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Issuer to comply with the obligation set forth in Section 5.03(b) in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, the Issuer must notify all Holders, the Trustee and the Paying Agent of such election.

The Issuer need not pay for any settlement effected without its prior written consent.
(f)                                   To secure the Issuer’s payment obligations in this Section 8.07, the Issuer hereby grants to the Trustee a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, other than money or property held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Securities.
If, at any time, the Issuer determines it is necessary to redeem the Securities in order to preserve the Parent Guarantor’s qualification as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“REIT”), the Issuer, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice delivered to the Holders, may redeem all of the Securities then Outstanding at 100% principal amount of the Securities, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
