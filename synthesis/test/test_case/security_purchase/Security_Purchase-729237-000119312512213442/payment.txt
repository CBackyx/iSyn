Heistand, President and Chief Executive Officer of Parkway commented, “We are making progress on our strategic initiatives through our asset disposition efforts and resulting repositioning of the portfolio.
Lastly, we believe we are aligned with shareholders in our efforts to maximize the value of our assets, while finding effective solutions to facilitate building critical mass in higher growth Sunbelt submarkets in the coming years.”Consolidated Financial Results for First Quarter Ended March 31, 2012Funds from operations (“FFO”) available to common shareholders totaled $10.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share as compared to $12.6 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the prior year period.
Recurring FFO totaled $10.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, as compared to $12.8 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the prior year period.
The reconciliation of FFO per diluted share to recurring FFO per diluted share is as follows: DescriptionFunds From OperationsUnusual and Non-Recurring Items (1):Change in Fair Value of Contingent ConsiderationNon-Recurring Lease Termination Fee IncomeLoss on Extinguishment of DebtAcquisition CostsRealignment Expenses – PersonnelOther    Recurring Funds From Operations    Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares and Units Outstanding (in 000s)     Funds available for distribution (“FAD”) totaled $3.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, as compared to $5.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the prior year period.Net income attributable to common shareholders was $2.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of $6.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share, for the prior year period.Operations and LeasingThe Company’s average rent per square foot was $22.55 during the first quarter 2012, as compared to $22.94 during the first quarter 2011.
On a same-store basis, the Company’s average rent per square foot was $20.20 during the first quarter 2012 as compared to $20.34 during the first quarter 2011.The Company’s average occupancy for the first quarter 2012 was 84.3% as compared to 84.7% for the first quarter 2011.
During the first quarter of 2012, 84 renewal, expansion and new leases were signed totaling 368,000 rentable square feet.
Included in this total were 46 renewal leases totaling 140,000 rentable square feet at an average rent per square foot of $22.41, representing a 7.9% rate decrease from the expiring rate, and at an average cost of $1.99 per square foot per year of the lease term.During the first quarter of 2012, 11 expansion leases were signed totaling 25,000 rentable square feet at an average rent per square foot of $24.27 and at an average cost of $5.35 per square foot per year of the lease term.During the first quarter of 2012, 27 new leases were signed totaling 203,000 rentable square feet at an average rent per square foot of $22.43 and at an average cost of $5.49 per square foot per year of the term.For the first quarter of 2012, Parkway’s share of recurring same-store net operating income (“NOI”) was $13.0 million on a GAAP basis and decreased $499,000 or 3.7% as compared to the same period of the prior year and was $11.6 million on a recurring cash basis and decreased $2.2 million or 15.9%.
The decrease in same-store recurring cash NOI is primarily attributable to the start of a five-month free rent period on January 1, 2012, associated with the renewal of a 205,000 square foot customer at One Commerce Green in Houston; a decline in rental income associated with the previous early renewal and contraction of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia, a 199,000 square foot customer at Capital City Plaza in Atlanta; and the loss in February 2011 of AutoTrader.com, a 198,000 square foot customer at Peachtree Dunwoody Pavilion in Atlanta.Asset RecyclingDuring the first quarter, the Company completed a significant portion of its previously announced dispositions as part of its strategic objective of becoming a leading owner of high quality office assets in higher growth markets in the Sunbelt.

(“Fund II”).
Parkway received approximately $4.0 million in net proceeds from both sales, which were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Company’s credit facility and fund its proportionate share of equity interests in additional purchases by Fund II.
The Pointe, a 252,000 square foot Class A office building in the Westshore submarket of Tampa, was purchased for a gross purchase price of $46.9 million.
Parkway’s equity contribution of $7.0 million was funded through the Company’s credit facility.Hayden Ferry Lakeside II (“Hayden Ferry II”), a 300,000 square foot Class A+ office building located in the Tempe submarket of Phoenix, and directly adjacent to Hayden Ferry Lakeside I purchased by Fund II in the second quarter of 2011, was purchased for a gross purchase price of $86.0 million.

This investment by TPG has been approved by Parkway’s Board of Directors, and the offering proceeds are expected to be received by the end of the second quarter, subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions.In addition, the Company announced that it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire Hearst Tower, a 972,000 square foot office tower located in the central business district of Charlotte, North Carolina.
The purchase price of $250 million, or $257 per square foot, represents a significant discount to estimated replacement cost, and the building is currently 94% leased with no material lease expirations until 2017.
The purchase of Hearst Tower will initially be funded using proceeds from the anticipated investment by TPG and borrowings from the Company’s revolving credit facility.
Hearst Tower is expected to generate cash net operating income of approximately $17.5 million during the first year of Parkway’s ownership period.Please see the Company’s separate press release dated May 3, 2012, for further detailed information regarding these subsequent events.Capital StructureAt March 31, 2012, the Company had an outstanding balance of $48.0 million under its credit facility and held $31.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $12.5 million of cash and cash equivalents was Parkway’s share.At March 31, 2012, the Company’s net debt to EBITDA multiple was 5.0x, after adjusting EBITDA for the pro forma annual impact of new investments and dispositions completed for the period, as compared to 5.4x at December 31, 2011, and 6.5x at March 31, 2011.
At March 31, 2012, the Company’s net debt plus preferred to EBITDA multiple was 6.8x, after adjusting EBITDA for the pro forma annual impact of new investments and dispositions completed for the period, as compared to 6.7x at December 31, 2011, and 7.5x at March 31, 2011.In January 2012, the Company placed a $23.5 million non-recourse mortgage loan, of which $7.1 million is Parkway’s share, secured by The Pointe in Tampa in connection with the purchase of this asset by Fund II.
This new mortgage loan matures in February 2019, has a fixed interest rate of 4.0%, and is interest only for the first 42 months of the term.In February 2012, the Company placed a $50.0 million non-recourse mortgage loan, of which $15.0 million is Parkway’s share, secured by Hayden Ferry II in connection with the purchase of this asset by Fund II.
This new mortgage loan matures in July 2018 and bears interest at LIBOR plus the applicable spread which ranges from 250 to 350 basis points over the term of the loan.
interest rate swap that fixes the LIBOR rate associated with this loan at 1.5% through January 25, 2018, which equates to a total interest rate ranging from approximately 4.0% to 5.0%.
The mortgage loan is cross-collateralized, cross-defaulted and coterminous with the mortgage loan secured by Hayden Ferry I.In March 2012, the Company repaid a $16.3 million non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Bank of America Plaza, a 337,000 square foot office property in Nashville.
The mortgage loan had a fixed interest rate of 7.1% and was scheduled to mature in May 2012.
The Company repaid the mortgage loan using amounts available under the Company’s credit facility.In March 2012, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a consortium of eight banks for its $190 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
Additionally, the Company amended its $10 million working capital revolving credit facility under substantially the same terms and conditions, with the combined size of the facilities remaining at $200 million (collectively, the “New Facilities”).The New Facilities provide for modifications to the existing facilities by, among other things, extending the maturity date from January 31, 2014 to March 29, 2016, with an additional one-year extension option with the payment of a fee, increasing the size of the accordion feature from $50 million to as much as $160 million, lowering applicable interest rate spreads and unused fees, and modifying certain other terms and financial covenants.
The interest rate on the New Facilities is based on LIBOR plus 160 to 235 basis points, depending upon overall Company leverage.
Additionally, the Company pays fees on the unused portion of the New Facilities ranging between 25 and 35 basis points based upon usage of the aggregate commitment.Common DividendThe Company’s previously announced first quarter cash dividend of $0.075 per share, which represents an annualized dividend of $0.30 per share, was paid on March 28, 2012 and represented a payout of approximately 17.0% of recurring FFO for the quarter.
The dividend was the 102nd consecutive quarterly distribution to Parkway’s shareholders of Common Stock.
After evaluating the earnings impact resulting from the Company’s recent acquisition and disposition activity, the Company’s first quarter financial results, and the pending purchase of Hearst Tower, the Board of Directors currently anticipates effecting a 33% increase in the common stock dividend, which would result in an annual dividend amount of $0.40 per share, assuming the completion of the pending TPG and Hearst Tower transactions and subject to formal approval by the Board at that time.2012 OutlookAfter considering the Company’s financial results during the first quarter, the completed and pending investment and capital activity to-date, as well as the proposed stock issuance to TPG and the proposed purchase of Hearst Tower, Parkway is reconfirming its 2012 reported FFO outlook at a range of $1.15 to $1.30 per share and adjusting its earnings (loss) per diluted share (“EPS”) to ($0.20) to ($0.05).
The reconciliation of projected EPS to projected FFO per diluted share is as follows: Outlook for 2012Fully diluted EPSParkway’s share of depreciation and amortizationParkway’s share of gain on sale of real estate  Reported FFO per diluted share  This outlook range does not include any speculative new acquisitions or any dispositions other than what we previously announced.
Parkway owns or has an interest in 43 office properties located in 10 states with an aggregate of approximately 10.0 million square feet of leasable space at May 3, 2012.

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARYRECLASSIFYING 16,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK INTOSERIES E CONVERTIBLE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKPARKWAY PROPERTIES, INC.PARKWAY PROPERTIES, INC., a Maryland corporation (the “Corporation”), hereby certifies to the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation that:FIRST: Pursuant to authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) by Article V, Section 3 the Charter of the Corporation (the “Charter”), and pursuant to the provisions of Section 2-208 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “M.G.C.L.”), the Board, at a meeting held on May 3, 2012, regarding the possible sale and issuance by the Corporation of convertible preferred stock, adopted resolutions duly classifying 16,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of the Corporation into a new series of 16,000,000 shares of preferred stock to be designated as “Series E Convertible Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share”, of the Corporation (the “Series E Preferred Stock”) and has provided for the issuance of such shares;SECOND: The reclassification increases the number of shares classified as Series E Preferred Stock from no shares immediately prior to the reclassification to 16,000,000 shares immediately after the reclassification.
This series of preferred stock is designated as Series E Convertible Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share.
The number of shares constituting the Series E Preferred Stock shall be 16,000,000.
The Series E Preferred Stock, both as to payment of dividends and to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall rank (a) senior to the Common Stock and each other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation hereafter created that does not expressly rank pari passu with or senior to the shares of Series E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (collectively, the “Junior Stock”) (b) pari passu with (i) the Corporation’s 8.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share (“Series D Preferred Stock”) and (ii) any class or series of preferred stock established in accordance with the terms of the Charter, the terms of which specifically provide that such class or series of capital stock ranks on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (collectively with the Series D Preferred Stock, the “Parity Stock”), and (c) junior to any class or 1
If the Corporation declares, pays or sets aside for payment any dividend on any share of Common Stock, then at the time of such dividend the Corporation shall simultaneously declare a dividend on each issued and outstanding share of Series E Preferred Stock, with payment to be in the same form as is being paid to the holders of Common Stock and in an amount equal to the product of (i) the applicable dividend payable on each share of Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series E Preferred Stock (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock), in each instance as calculated on the record date for determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend.
Such dividend will be paid to the holders of record at the close of business on the date specified by the Board at the time such dividend is declared, which shall be on or prior to the payment date for the applicable dividend on a share of Common Stock.
(b) Mandatory Dividends on Series E Preferred.
The Corporation shall pay quarterly dividends in cash (except as provided below) when, as and if declared by the Board, out of funds legally available therefor as provided by the M.G.C.L.
(“Legally Available Funds”), on each issued and outstanding share of Series E Preferred Stock in an amount, if positive, equal to (i) the Liquidation Preference of such share of Series E Preferred Stock multiplied by the Applicable Quarterly Dividend Rate (as defined below) minus (ii) the amount of any dividend paid or being concurrently paid, as the case may be, on such share of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(a) during the Series E Quarterly Period (as defined below) to which such quarterly dividend relates (and, to the extent not previously deducted from a prior quarterly dividend, the amount of any dividend paid pursuant to Section 2(a) during the preceding Series E Quarterly Period, excluding the first Series E Quarterly Period).
Such dividends shall, beginning on the Mandatory Dividend Commencement Date, be cumulative and payable (if declared) quarterly on each Applicable Quarterly Dividend Payment Date (except that if such date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then such dividend will be payable on the preceding Business Day) to the holders of record at the close of business on the date specified by the Board at the time such dividend is declared.
The first such dividend shall be for a period of less than a full quarter.
Payment Dates following the Mandatory Dividend Commencement Date may be paid by the issuance of additional shares of Series E Preferred Stock with an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the amount of the dividend; provided, however, that the Corporation shall pay such dividends in cash instead of issuing such additional shares of Series E Preferred Stock if, immediately after giving effect to such proposed issuance and assuming (immediately following such proposed issuance) the conversion of all such shares of Series E Preferred Stock then held by TPG and its affiliates, TPG and its affiliates would hold in excess of forty nine percent (49.0%) of the Common Stock issued and outstanding.
(c) Cumulative Dividends.
Dividends on the shares of Series E Preferred Stock will accrue daily whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are Legally Available Funds and whether or not such dividends are declared and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and, for any period greater or less than a full year will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period divided by 365.
No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on Series E Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.
Any dividend payment with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b) above shall first be credited against any prior accrued and unpaid dividends.
All dividends paid with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2 shall be paid pro rata in respect of each share of Series E Preferred Stock entitled thereto.
For purposes of these Articles Supplementary, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below:(i) “Applicable Quarterly Dividend Payment Date” shall mean, with respect to any Series E Quarterly Period, the date during such period on which the Corporation is to pay its quarterly Common Stock dividend, and if no such dividend is paid during such period, the last day of such Series E Quarterly Period.
(ii) “Applicable Quarterly Dividend Rate” shall mean, with respect to any share of Series E Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding, (A) eight percent (8%) per annum for the first three (3) Series E Quarterly Periods beginning on the Mandatory Dividend Commencement Date, (B) twelve percent (12%) per annum for four (4) Series E Quarterly Periods following such first three (3) Series E Quarterly Periods and (C) fifteen percent (15%) per annum for each Series E Quarterly Period following such first seven (7) Series E Quarterly Periods.
(v) “Liquidation Preference” shall mean $11.25 per share of Series E Preferred Stock, as such amount may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms hereof.
(vi) “Mandatory Dividend Commencement Date” shall mean one hundred eighty (180) days after the Issue Date.
(i) From and after the five (5) year anniversary of the Issue Date, each holder of Series E Preferred Stock will have the right, at such holder’s option, to require that the Corporation, to the extent it shall have Legally Available Funds therefor, redeem all but not less than all of such holder’s Series E Preferred Stock at a redemption price per share of Series E Preferred Stock (to be paid in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds) equal to the greater of (A) the Liquidation Preference of a share of Series E Preferred Stock plus the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without interest, and (B) the Average Closing Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series E Preferred Stock could be converted in accordance with Section 6 (but, for purposes of this clause (B), without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock and without taking into account any adjustment to the Conversion Ratio (as defined below) pursuant to Section 6(g)), in each case measured as of the date on which the Corporation receives a General Election Notice (as defined below) or the last Trading Day immediately prior to such date, in each instance pursuant to this Section 4(a)(i).
“Average Closing Price” shall mean, as of any date, the average closing price per share of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Corporation’s Common Stock is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, then on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or, if the Common Stock is not listed on a U.S. national or regional securities exchange, then on the principal other market on which the Common Stock is then traded or quoted) as reported by Bloomberg L.P. for the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding such date.
(iii) On the closing date set forth in any General Redemption Notice, the Corporation will, to the extent lawful, purchase from such holder of Series E Preferred Stock (but only upon surrender by such holder at the Corporation’s office specified in the General Redemption Notice of the certificates representing such shares or, if such certificate or certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and indemnity in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Corporation), such holder’s shares of Series E Preferred Stock at a price per share (to be paid in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds) specified in the General Redemption Notice.

(ii) If the Corporation shall, while any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue rights, options or warrants to holders of Common Stock (other than any issuances pursuant to the Corporation’s existing compensation arrangements for its directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents or any future compensation arrangements for its directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents that are approved by the Corporation’s compensation committee) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at a price per share less than the Average Closing Price, measured as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, then the Conversion Ratio in effect at the opening of business on the day next following such record date shall be adjusted to equal the ratio determined by dividing (A) the Conversion Ratio in effect at the opening of business on the day next following such record date by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus (II) the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate proceeds to the Corporation from the exercise of such rights or warrants for Common Stock would purchase at such Average Closing Price, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (X) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and (Y) the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to such rights or warrants.
