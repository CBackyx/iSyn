In such case, (i) the Company may designate the managing underwriter(s) of the Underwritten Offering, provided that such Holders may designate a co-managing underwriter to participate in the Underwritten Offering, subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) the Company shall (together with the Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form for underwriting agreements for firm commitment offerings of equity securities with the managing underwriter(s) proposing to distribute their securities through such Underwritten Offering, which underwriting agreement shall have indemnification provisions in substantially the form as set forth in Section 4.8 of this Agreement; provided, that (i) the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of the underwriter(s) shall also be made to and for the benefit of the Holders proposing to distribute their securities through the Underwritten Offering, (ii) no Holder shall be required to make any representations and warranties to, or agreements with, any underwriter in a registration other than customary representations, warranties and agreements and (iii) the liability of each Holder in respect of any indemnification, contribution or other obligation of such Holder arising under such underwriting agreement (a) shall be limited to losses arising out of or based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement, incorporated document or other such disclosure document or other document or report, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for inclusion therein and (b) shall not in any event, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, exceed an amount equal to the net proceeds to such Holder (after deduction of all underwriters’ discounts and commissions) from the disposition of the Registrable Securities disposed of by such Holder pursuant to such Underwritten Offering.
No Holder may participate in any such Underwritten Offering unless such Holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers 15
The Company shall not be obligated to effect or participate (a) more than two (2) Underwritten Offerings in any twelve (12) month period, and (b) in any Underwritten Offering during any lock-up period required by the underwriter(s) in any prior underwritten offering conducted by the Company on its own behalf or on behalf of the Holders.
(c) If, in connection with an Underwritten Offering, the managing underwriter(s) advise the Company that in its or their reasonable opinion the number of securities proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the Underwriters’ Maximum Number, then (i) the Company shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering and (ii) the Company will be obligated and required to include in such Underwritten Offering only that number of Registrable Securities requested by the Holders thereof to be included in such registration that does not exceed such Underwriters’ Maximum Number, such Registrable Securities to be allocated pro rata among the Holders thereof on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein by each such Holder.
No shares of Common Stock held by any Person other than Registrable Securities held by the Holders shall be included in a Demand Registration without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities.
(d) A registration will not be deemed to have been effected as a Demand Registration unless the Registration Statement relating thereto has been declared effective by the SEC, at least 75% of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the registration by the Holders are included in such registration, and the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after it has become effective, (i) such Registration Statement or the related offer, sale or distribution of Registrable Securities thereunder is or becomes the subject of any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental or administrative agency, or if any court prevents or otherwise limits the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration, and in each case less than all of the Registrable Securities covered by the effective Registration Statement are actually sold by the selling Holder or Holders pursuant to the Registration Statement, or (ii) if, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Company fails to provide Full Cooperation, then such registration will be deemed not to have been effected for purposes of clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 4.1(a).
If (i) a registration requested pursuant to this Section 4.1 is deemed not to have been effected as a Demand Registration or (ii) the registration requested pursuant to this Section 4.1 does not remain continuously effective until forty-five (45) days after the commencement of the distribution by the Holders of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration, then the Company shall continue to be obligated to effect a Demand Registration pursuant to this Section 4.1 of the Registrable Securities included in such registration.
In circumstances not including the events described in the immediately two preceding sentences of this Section 4.1(d), each Holder of Registrable Securities shall be permitted voluntarily to withdraw all or any part of its Registrable Securities from a Demand Registration at any time prior to the commencement of marketing of such Demand Registration, provided that such registration nonetheless shall count as a Demand Registration for purposes of clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 4.1(a).
Section 4.2 Piggyback Registration.
The Holders of Registrable Securities shall be permitted to withdraw all or any part of their shares from any Piggyback Registration at any time on or before the fifth business day prior to the planned effective date of such Piggyback Registration, except as otherwise provided in any written agreement with the Company’s underwriter(s) establishing the terms and conditions under which such Holders would be obligated to sell such securities in such Piggyback Registration.
(c) If a Piggyback Registration is an Underwritten Offering on behalf of a holder of Company securities other than Holders, and the managing underwriter(s) advise the Company that in its or their reasonable opinion the number of securities proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the Underwriters’ Maximum Number, then the Company shall include in such registration (i) first, the number of securities requested to be included therein by the holder(s) originally requesting such registration, (ii) second, the number of securities requested to be included therein by all Holders who have requested registration of Registrable Securities in accordance with Section 4.2(a), pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of Registrable Securities requested to be included by each such Holder and (iii) third, any other securities that have been requested to be so included by any other person.
(d) In any Piggyback Registration that is an Underwritten Offering, the Company shall have the right to select the managing underwriter(s) for such registration.
(e) The Company shall not grant to any Person the right to request the Company to register any shares of Company securities in a Piggyback Registration unless such rights are consistent with the provisions of this Section 4.2.Section 4.3 Registration Expenses.
In connection with registrations pursuant to Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 hereof, the Company shall pay all of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the registrations thereunder (the “Registration Expenses”), including all (a) registration and filing fees and expenses, including, without limitation, those related to filings 17

In the case of each registration effected by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall keep each Holder advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and as to the completion thereof.
In connection with any such registration:(a) The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event, within 90 days) after its receipt of the request for registration under Section 4.1(a), prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-1, Form S-3 or another appropriate Securities Act form reasonably acceptable to the Holders, and use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective until the completion of the distribution contemplated thereby.
(b) The Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments to each Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for as long as such registration is required to remain effective pursuant to the terms hereof, (ii) cause the prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and, as so supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and (iii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the Holders set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the prospectus.
(d) The Company will promptly notify each Holder of any stop order issued or threatened by the SEC and, if entered, use reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it as soon as reasonably possible.
(e) On or prior to the date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder reasonably requests and do any and all other lawful acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the Holders to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of such Registrable Securities, and use commercially reasonable efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period which the Registration Statement is required to be kept effective; provided that the Company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (e), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction.
Each Holder hereby agrees to keep any disclosures under subsection (iv) above confidential until such time as a supplement or amendment is filed.
(j) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to the terms hereof to be listed on each national securities exchange on which the Common Stock of the Company is then listed.
(k) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist in obtaining of all necessary approvals from FINRA, if any.
(n) The Company otherwise shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.
(p) In connection with each Demand Registration, the Company shall cause there to occur Full Cooperation.For purposes of Section 4.4(a) and Section 4.4(b), the period of distribution of Registrable Securities in a firm commitment underwritten public offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter has completed the distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of distribution of Registrable Securities in any other registration shall be deemed to extend until the earlier of the sale of all Registrable Securities covered thereby and one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date thereof.Section 4.5 Holders’ Obligations.
The Company may postpone effecting a registration or apply the limitations on dispositions specified in clause (ii) of this Section 4.6(a) if (x) the Company Board, in good faith, determines that such registration or disposition would materially impede, delay or interfere with any material transaction then pending or proposed to be undertaken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (y) the Company in good faith determines that the Company is in possession of material non-public information the disclosure of which during the period specified in such notice the Company Board, in good faith, reasonably believes would not be in the best interests of the Company; provided that the Company may not take any actions pursuant to this Section 4.6(a) for a period of time in excess of ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any twelve (12)-month period.
The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to timely file with the SEC such information as the SEC may require under Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action as may be required as a condition to the availability of Rule 144 or Rule 144A under the Securities Act with respect to its Common Stock.
Certificates evidencing Registrable Securities shall not contain any legend at such time as a Holder has provided reasonable evidence to the 22
Company (including any customary broker’s or selling stockholder’s letters but expressly excluding an opinion of counsel other than with respect to clauses (d) or (e) below), that (a) there has been a sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to an effective registration statement, (b) there has been a sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 (assuming the transferor is not an affiliate of the Company), (c) such Registrable Securities are then eligible for sale under Rule 144(b)(i), (d) in connection with a sale, assignment or other transfer (other than under Rule 144), upon request of the Company, such Holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel to such Holder, in a reasonably acceptable form, to the effect that such sale, assignment or transfer of the Registrable Securities may be made without registration under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or (e) such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including controlling judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the SEC).
The Company agrees, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder and each of its managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, together with the managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of such controlling Person (each, a “Controlling Person”), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, settlement amounts (only if the Company consented in writing to the settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), liabilities, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses of investigating and defending any such claim (collectively, “Damages”) and any action in respect thereof to which such Holder, its managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents, and any such Controlling Persons may become subject to under the Securities Act or otherwise, but only insofar as such Damages (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus of the Company (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus of the Company, or arise out of, or are based upon, any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made, except insofar as the same are based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder or any of its managers, members, managing members, general partners, officers, directors, employees, agents and Controlling Persons expressly for use therein, and, consistent with and subject to the foregoing, shall reimburse such 23
Holder, its managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents, and each such Controlling Person for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such Holder, its managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents, or any such Controlling Person in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such Damages or proceedings.
In addition to the indemnity contained herein, the Company will reimburse each Holder for its reasonable out-of-pocket legal and other expenses (including the reasonable out-of-pocket cost of any investigation, preparation and travel in connection therewith) as incurred in connection therewith, as promptly as practicable after such expenses are incurred and invoiced.
(b) Indemnification by the Holder.
The Holders agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, employees and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, together with the managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of such controlling Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Holders, but only with respect to information related to the Holders, or their plan of distribution, furnished in writing by the Holders or any of their managers, members, managing members, general partners, officers, directors, employees, agents and Controlling Persons to the Company expressly for use in any Registration Statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus.
No Holder shall be required to indemnify any Person pursuant to this Section 4.8(b) for any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold for the account of such Holder.
(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings.
If any such claim or action shall be brought against an Indemnified Party, and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified Indemnifying Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnified Party and its Controlling Persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of, and reimbursement of fees for, such counsel or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest between 24
them, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or action or separate but substantially similar or related claims or actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all Indemnified Parties.
No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or would reasonably have been a party and indemnity would reasonably have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.
Whether or not the defense of any claim or action is assumed by the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its written consent.Section 4.9 No Inconsistent Agreements.
The Company shall not hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities (including any registration or similar agreement) which is inconsistent with or violates the material rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement.Section 4.10 Lock-Up Agreements.
Each of the Holders and the Company agrees that, in connection with an Underwritten Offering in respect of which Registrable Securities are being sold, or in connection with any other public offering of Common Stock by the Company, if requested by the underwriter(s), it will enter into customary “lock-up” agreements pursuant to which it will agree not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or any securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (subject to customary exceptions), other than any issuance of upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the effective date of the Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable Securities or from such other date as may be requested by the underwriter(s).
The Company further agrees that, in connection with an Underwritten Offering in respect of which Registrable Securities are being sold, if requested by the managing underwriter(s), it will exercise its best efforts to obtain agreements (in the underwriters’ customary form) from its directors and executive officers not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or any securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (subject to customary exceptions), for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the effective date of the Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable Securities or from such other date as may be requested by the underwriter(s).Section 4.11 Termination of Registration Rights.
The rights and obligations provided in this Article IV may be assigned in whole or in part by any Holder to a controlled affiliate of such Holder or to any member, general or limited partner or stockholder of any such Holder (each, a “Permitted Transferee”) without the consent of the Company or any other Holder.
Except as set forth in this Section 4.12, the rights and obligations provided in this Article IV may not be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto.ARTICLE VCOVENANTSSection 5.1 Standstill.

For so long as this Agreement remains in effect, neither the Company nor TPG shall enter into any stockholder agreement or arrangement of any kind with any Person with respect to any Shares or other Securities, or otherwise act or agree to act in concert with any Person with respect to any Shares or other Securities, to the extent such agreement, arrangement, or concerted act would controvert, or otherwise be inconsistent in any material respect with, the provisions of this Agreement.Section 5.3 Further Assurances.
This Agreement may not be amended, except by an agreement in writing, executed by each of TPG and the Company, and compliance with any term of this Agreement may not be waived, except by an agreement in writing executed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver is intended to be effective.
The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of any such provision and shall not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.
Section 6.2 Severability.
If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, or otherwise unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Law, shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and effect.
Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.Section 6.3 Entire Agreement.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.Section 6.5 Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.Section 6.6 Remedies.
(a) Each party hereto acknowledges that monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that each and every one of the covenants or agreements in this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms, and it is therefore agreed that, in addition to, and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, the non-breaching party will have the right to an injunction, temporary restraining order, or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and enforcing specifically each and every one of the terms and provisions hereof.
Each party hereto agrees not to oppose the granting of such relief in the event a court determines that such a breach has occurred, and to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.
(b) All rights, powers, and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at Law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power, or remedy by such party.Section 6.7 Notices.

The Company will indemnify, exonerate and hold the Manager, the Manager Designees and each of their respective partners, shareholders, members, affiliates, associated investment funds, directors, officers, fiduciaries, managers, controlling persons, employees and agents and each of the partners, shareholders, members, affiliates, associated investment funds, directors, officers, fiduciaries, managers, controlling persons, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (collectively, the “Indemnitees”), each of whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, free and harmless from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, liabilities, losses, damages and costs and out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them before or after the date of this Agreement (collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”) arising out of any action, cause of action, suit, arbitration, investigation or claim (whether between the relevant Indemnitee and the Company or involving a third party claim against the relevant Indemnitee), or in any way arising out of or directly or indirectly relating to (i) this Agreement, the Transaction, any of the Transaction Documents or any related documents or instruments, any transaction to which the Company is a party or any other circumstances with respect to the Company or (ii) operations of, or services provided by the Manager or the Manager Designees to, the Company or any of its affiliates from time to time; provided that the foregoing indemnification rights will not be available to the extent that any such Indemnified Liabilities arose on account of such Indemnitee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; and provided, further, that if and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unavailable or unenforceable for any reason, the Company hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.
For purposes of this Section 5(b), none of the circumstances described in the limitations contained in the two provisos in the immediately preceding sentence will be deemed to apply absent a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to such effect, in which case to the extent any such limitation is so determined to apply to any Indemnitee as to any previously advanced indemnity payments made by the Company, then such payments will be promptly repaid by such Indemnitee to the Company without interest.
The rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification hereunder will be in addition to any other rights any such person or entity may have under any other agreement or instrument referenced above or any other agreement or instrument to which such Indemnitee is or becomes a party or is or otherwise becomes a beneficiary or under law or regulation; provided that (i) the Company hereby agrees that it is the indemnitor of first resort under this Agreement and under any other applicable indemnification agreement (i.e., their obligations to Indemnitees under this Agreement or any other agreement or undertaking to provide advancement and/or indemnification to such Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the Manager (or any affiliate thereof other than the Company) to provide advancement or indemnification for the Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees are secondary) and (ii) if the Manager (or any affiliate thereof) pays or causes to be paid, for any reason, any amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder or under any other indemnification agreement (whether pursuant to contract, by-laws or charter) with any Indemnitee, then (x) the Manager (or such affiliate, as the case may be) will be fully subrogated to all rights of such Indemnitee with respect to such payment and (y) the Company will fully indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless the Manager (or such other affiliate) for all such payments actually made by the Manager (or such other affiliate) and irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Manager for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any advancement of expenses or indemnification hereunder.

Examples of forward-looking statements include projected net operating income, cap rates, internal rates of return, future dividend payment rates, forecasts of FFO accretion, projected capital improvements, expected sources of financing, expectations as to the timing of closing of acquisitions, dispositions, or other transactions, including the proposed purchase of the Hearst Tower and the TPG equity investment, and descriptions relating to these expectations.
There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those anticipated by the Company.
These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the control of the Company) and are subject to change based upon various factors, including but not limited to the following risks and uncertainties: changes in the real estate industry and in performance of the financial markets; the demand for and market acceptance of the Company’s properties for rental purposes; the amount and growth of the 6
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
Any forward looking statements speaks only as of the date on which it is made.
New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence of those matters or the manner in which they may affect us.
The Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements except as may be required by law.Neither the common stock nor the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock to be issued in the investment transaction described herein, nor the common units into which the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock may become convertible, have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and they may not be offered or sold in the United States absent a registration statement or exemption from registration.Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFFO, FAD, NOI and EBITDA, including related per share amounts, are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs and should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of the Company.
Management believes that FFO, FAD, NOI and EBITDA are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.
Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.
Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.
FFO, FAD, NOI and EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
FFO, FAD, NOI and EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
The Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.FFO – Parkway computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition.
FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, reduced by preferred dividends, excluding gains or losses on depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization.
Adjustments for Parkway’s share of partnerships and joint ventures are included in the computation of FFO on the same basis.
On October 31, 2011, NAREIT issued updated guidance on reporting FFO such that impairment losses on depreciable real estate should be excluded from the computation of FFO for current and prior periods presented.
Recurring FFO – In addition to FFO, Parkway also discloses recurring FFO, which considers Parkway’s share of adjustments for non-recurring lease termination fees, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments or other unusual items.
Although this is a non-GAAP measure that differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, the Company believes it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance.FAD – There is not a generally accepted definition established for FAD.
Therefore, the Company’s measure of FAD may not be comparable to FAD reported by other REITs.
Parkway defines FAD as FFO, excluding the amortization of share-based compensation, amortization of above and below market leases, straight line rent adjustments, gains and losses, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of loan costs, non-cash charges and reduced by recurring non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs.
Adjustments for Parkway’s share of partnerships and joint ventures are included in the computation of FAD on the same basis.EBITDA – Parkway defines EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income before interest expense, amortization of financing costs, amortization of share-based compensation, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition costs, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, other gains and losses and fair value adjustments.
Adjustments for Parkway’s share of partnerships and joint ventures are included in the computation of EBITDA on the same basis.
EBITDA, as calculated by us, is not comparable to EBITDA reported by other REITs that do not define EBITDA exactly as we do.
EBITDA does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity.NOI, Recurring NOI, Same-Store NOI and Recurring Same-Store NOI – NOI includes income from real estate operations less property operating expenses (before interest expense and depreciation and amortization).
In addition to NOI, Parkway discloses recurring NOI, which considers adjustments for non-recurring lease termination fees or other unusual items.
The Company’s disclosure of same-store NOI and recurring same-store NOI includes those properties that were owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties classified as discontinued operations.Additional Information About the Proposed Transaction and Where to Find ItThis communication is being made in respect of the proposed equity investment involving Parkway and certain affiliates of TPG, a global private investment firm.
STOCKHOLDERS AND INVESTORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT (AND OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALS) REGARDING THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE, AND BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, AS IT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTION.
Certain Information Regarding ParticipantsParkway and its directors and executive officers may be deemed, under SEC rules, to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from Parkway’s stockholders regarding the conversion of any shares of preferred stock of Parkway issued to TPG in connection with TPG’s proposed equity investment in Parkway into shares of Parkway’s common stock.
Security holders may obtain information regarding the names, affiliations and interests of such individuals in Parkway’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the SEC on March 12, 2012, and its definitive proxy statement for the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, which was filed with the SEC on April 5, 2012.

FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reduced by preferred dividends, excluding gains or losses on depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization.
Adjustments for Parkway’s share of partnerships and joint ventures are included in the computation of FFO on the same basis.
On October 31, 2011, NAREIT issued updated guidance on reporting FFO such that impairment losses on depreciable real estate should be excluded from the computation of FFO for current and prior periods.Recurring Funds From Operations (Recurring FFO)Recurring FFO considers Parkway’s share of adjustments for non-recurring lease termination fees, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments or other unusual items.
Although this is a non-GAAP measure that differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, the Company believes it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance.Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)There is not a generally accepted definition established for FAD.
Therefore, the Company’s measure of FAD may not be comparable to FAD reported by other REITs.
Parkway defines FAD as FFO, excluding the amortization of share based compensation, amortization of above and below market leases, straight line rent adjustments, gains and losses, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of loan costs, non-cash charges and reduced by recurring non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs.
Adjustments for Parkway’s share of partnerships and joint ventures are included in the computation of FAD on the same basis.EBITDAParkway defines EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income before interest expense, amortization of financing costs, amortization of share-based compensation, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition costs, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, other gains and losses and fair value adjustments.
Adjustments for Parkway’s share of partnerships and joint ventures are included in the computation of EBITDA on the same basis.
EBITDA, as calculated by us, is not comparable to EBITDA reported by other REITs that do not define EBITDA exactly as we do.
EBITDA does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity.Annualized Rental RevenueAnnualized Rental Revenue represents the gross rental rate (including escalations) multiplied by the number of square feet leased by the customer.
However, square footage presented represents 100% of square feet through direct ownership or through joint ventures.
Same-store net operating income (“SSNOI”) includes income from real estate operations less property operating expenses (before interest and depreciation and amortization) for same-store properties.
SSNOI as computed by Parkway may not be comparable to SSNOI reported by other REITs that do not define the measure exactly as we do.
SSNOI is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the Company’s investments in real estate assets.Forward Looking StatementCertain statements in this package that are not in the present or past tense or discuss the Company’s expectations (including the use of the words anticipate, believe, forecast, intends, expects, project, or similar expressions) are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and as such are based upon the Company’s current belief as to the outcome and timing of future events.

Such surrender shall be made in accordance with Section 6(c).

No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock.
If more than one share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the shareholder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Series E Preferred Stock so surrendered.
The Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:(i) If the Corporation shall, while any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution with respect to its capital stock in shares of its Common Stock (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any dividends paid in shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(b))), (B) subdivide its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (C) combine its outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D) issue any shares of capital stock by reclassification of its Common Stock, the Conversion Ratio in effect at the opening of business on the day next following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (in the case of the foregoing clause (A)), or at the opening of business on the day following the day on which such subdivision, combination or reclassification becomes effective (in the cases of the foregoing clauses (B), (C) and (D)), shall be adjusted and shall become effective immediately so that the holder of any Series E Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such Series E Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to the record date (in the case of the foregoing clause (A)) or the effective date (in the cases of the foregoing clauses (B), (C) and (D)).
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day immediately following such record date.
In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders of Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a per share price that is less than such Average Closing Price, all consideration received by the Corporation upon issuance and upon exercise of such rights or warrants shall be taken into account, the value of such consideration, if in a form other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors in the reasonable exercise of their business judgment.
In the event that the Stockholder Approval is not obtained within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Issue Date then, upon the occurrence of such event, each of the Conversion Ratio and the Liquidation Preference shall immediately be adjusted, such that, immediately following such adjustment, each of the Conversion Ratio and the Liquidation Preference, as adjusted, is equal to the product of one hundred and ten percent (110%) multiplied by the amount of the Conversion Ratio and the Liquidation Preference, respectively, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.
In the event the Corporation takes any action that affects the Common Stock in a manner that could materially adversely affect the conversion rights of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock or the value of such conversion rights (which action is not otherwise contemplated by this Section 6), the Conversion Ratio for the Series E Preferred Stock may be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, as the members of the Board of Directors (excluding, for the purposes of this Section 6(i), any directors who have been nominated by TPG), in the exercise of their reasonable business judgment, shall determine to be equitable in the circumstances.
(j) Reservation and Validity.
(i) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock for the purpose of effecting conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding Series E Preferred Stock not therefore converted or redeemed.
(ii) The Corporation covenants that any shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
(k) Transfer Taxes.
The Corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property in a name other than that of the holder of the Series E Preferred Stock to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or established, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.Section 7.
Status of Redeemed Stock.
All shares of Series E Preferred Stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Corporation (including, without limitation, shares of Series E Preferred Stock which have been surrendered for conversion) shall be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Series E Preferred Stock and shall not be re-issued as Series E Preferred Stock or transferred by the Corporation without the written consent of TPG (regardless of whether TPG or any of its affiliates owns any shares of Series E Preferred Stock); provided, however, that the Corporation may, at any time, reclassify such shares of Series E Preferred Stock as Common Stock without the consent of TPG.
