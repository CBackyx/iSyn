References herein to the “accrual” of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared.
So long as any share of Series A Preferred remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date, full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the corporation will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than:(i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries;(ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan; or(iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock for any other class or series of Junior Stock.The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the corporation where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid.Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series A Preferred remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series A Preferred, all dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series A Preferred bear to each other.Subject to the foregoing and paragraph C(4)(b) of this Article FOURTH , and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the corporation’s Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.
If a Conversion Date for any shares of Series A Preferred is prior to the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, the Holder of such shares will not be entitled to any such dividend.
However, such shares, upon surrender for conversion, must be accompanied by funds equal to the dividend on such shares; provided that no such payment need be made (i) if the corporation has issued a notice of a Sale Transaction during the then-current Dividend Period or (ii) if the corporation has issued a notice of conversion at its option of the Series A Preferred.5.
Liquidation Rights.
(c) Residual Distributions.
If the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which all Holders are entitled have been paid, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.6.
A Sale Transaction shall be deemed to be a Liquidation Event for purposes of paragraph C(5) of Article FOURTH.
(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder’s option, to convert all or any portion of such Holder’s Series A Preferred at any time prior to the consummation of a Sale Transaction into shares of Common Stock as set forth in paragraph C(7) of this Article FOURTH and subject to the conversion procedures of paragraph C(8) of this Article FOURTH; and (ii) the corporation will not effect any Sale Transaction unless proper provision is made to ensure that the Holders of shares of Series A Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Sale Transaction shall be entitled to liquidating distributions as provided in paragraph C(5) of this Article FOURTH.7.
Right of the Holders to Convert.
(b) Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
Notwithstanding paragraph C(7)(a) of this Article FOURTH, the corporation shall not effect any conversion of shares of Series A Preferred held by a Holder other than member of the Steans Family or the Taylor Family (each as defined in Article FIFTH of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) or any Affiliate of any such member (any such other Holder, a “Limited Holder”), and a Limited Holder shall not have the right to convert any shares of Series A Preferred, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth in the applicable Conversion Notice, such Limited Holder (together with such Limited Holder’s Affiliates, and any other person or entity acting as a group together with such Limited Holder or any of such Limited Holder’s Affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below); provided, however that the limitations set forth in this sentence shall not apply to any conversion of the Series A Preferred (i) at the option of the corporation pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article FOURTH or (ii) immediately prior to the consummation of a Sale Transaction (provided that the Limited Holder may submit a Conversion Notice with respect to such conversion prior thereto and contingent thereon).
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Limited Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred with
respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, unconverted shares of Series A Preferred beneficially owned by such Limited Holder or any of its Affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by such Limited Holder or any of its Affiliates.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The submission by a Holder of a Conversion Notice shall be deemed to be a representation by such Holder that such Holder has determined that all of the shares of Series A Preferred to be converted as set forth in such Conversion Notice may be converted without violating the restrictions set forth in this paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH, and the corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
For purposes of this paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (A) the corporation’s most recent quarterly or annual report filed with Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the corporation or (C) a more recent written notice by the corporation or the corporation’s transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the corporation, including the Series A Preferred, by such Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.
The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred by the applicable Holder as set forth in the applicable Conversion Notice.
The provisions of this paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH to correct this paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.
The limitations contained in this paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH shall apply to any successor Limited Holder of shares of Series A Preferred.8.
Conversion Procedures.
Effective immediately prior to the close of business on any applicable Conversion Date, dividends shall no longer be declared on any such converted shares of Series A Preferred, and such shares of Series A Preferred shall represent only the right to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares, as set forth in paragraph C(7) of this Article FOURTH, in each case, subject to the right of Holders to receive any declared and unpaid dividends on such shares and any other payments to which they are otherwise entitled pursuant to the terms hereof.
(b) Rights Prior to Conversion.
No allowance or adjustment, except pursuant to paragraph C(10) of this Article FOURTH, shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of the Common Stock of record as of any date prior to the close of business on any applicable Conversion Date.
Prior to the close of business on any applicable Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of, or other securities issuable upon conversion of, any shares of Series A Preferred shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion or rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion) by virtue of holding shares of Series A Preferred.
The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on any applicable Conversion Date.
Conversion at the Option of the Corporation.
The corporation shall have the right, at its option, to cause some or all of the Series A Preferred to be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-applicable Conversion Rate at any time after a Mandatory Conversion Event.
If the corporation elects to cause less than all the shares of the Series A Preferred to be converted under clause (a) above, the Conversion Agent shall select the Series A Preferred to be converted on a pro rata basis.
Anti-Dilution Adjustments.
If the corporation at any time after the effective date hereof subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable upon exercise of the Series A Preferred will be proportionately increased.
If the corporation at any time after the effective date hereof combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased and the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable upon exercise of the Series A Preferred will be proportionately decreased.
Any subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock, and adjustment of the Conversion Price resulting therefrom pursuant to this paragraph C(10) of this Article FOURTH, shall be subject to the prior approval of the Executive Committee in accordance with Article FIFTH hereof.
(b) Distribution of Assets.
If the corporation shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement or other similar transaction but excluding any ordinary cash dividend payable with respect to the Common Stock consistent with past practice) (a “Distribution”), at any time after the issuance of the Series A Preferred and prior to a Dividend Conversion Date, then, in each such case, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the Distribution shall be reduced, effective as of the close of business on such record date, to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which (A) the numerator shall be the VWAP of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding such record date minus the value of the Distribution (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) applicable to one share of Common Stock, and (B) the denominator shall be the VWAP of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding such record date.
If at any time the corporation grants, issues or sells any options to purchase shares of Common Stock, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of its capital stock (the “Purchase Rights”) prior to a Dividend Conversion Date, then each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights that such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder’s shares of Series A Preferred immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.
(d) No Fractional Shares.
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to holders of the Series A Preferred upon conversion.
Voting Rights.
The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in this paragraph C(11) of this Article FOURTH or as required by Delaware law.
(b) General Voting Rights.
Each share of Series A Preferred shall entitle the Holder thereof to vote on all matters voted on by holders of the capital stock of the corporation into which such share of Series A Preferred is convertible, voting together as a single class with the other shares entitled to vote, at all meetings of stockholders of the corporation, including with
respect to the election of directors.
With respect to any such vote in which the Holders participate, the shares of Series A Preferred shall entitle the Holder thereof to cast the number of votes equal to the lesser of (i) the total number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation into which such shares of Series A Preferred are convertible on the record date for such vote (giving effect to paragraph C(7)(b) of this Article FOURTH) and (ii) the product of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred held by such Holder, multiplied by 1.961 (subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations or reclassifications).12.
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the consent of the Holders of a majority of the number of shares of Series A Preferred at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by vote, at a special or annual meeting, voting or consenting as a separate class, shall be necessary to: (i) authorize or issue, or obligate the corporation to issue, any other capital stock or security or right convertible or exchangeable for capital stock of the corporation that is senior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred as to payment of dividends or rights on liquidation; (ii) issue any shares of Series A Preferred; (iii) increase the authorized number of shares of the Series A Preferred; (iv) enter any agreement, contract or understanding or otherwise incur any obligation which by its terms would violate or be in conflict in any material respect with the rights or preferences of the Series A Preferred designated hereunder; (v) amend the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the corporation, if such amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred so as to affect them adversely; or (vi) amend or waive any provision of this paragraph C of this Article FOURTH.13.

“New Securities” shall mean any shares of capital stock or securities or rights convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for capital stock of the corporation (“Convertible Securities”); provided, however, that New Securities does not include:(i) capital stock issued or issuable on conversion or exercise of the Series A Preferred, options or warrants to purchase Common Stock or other convertible securities that either are (x) outstanding on the date of the effectiveness of this paragraph C of this Article FOURTH, (y) warrants to purchase Common Stock issued on or within 90 days after the date of

Securities within such period, the corporation shall not thereafter issue or sell any such New Securities without again first offering such securities to the Holders in the manner provided in this paragraph C(13) of this Article FOURTH.14.

All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series A Preferred shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).

statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Company in connection therewith, or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and the Company will reimburse each such Holder Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 1.9(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the written consent of the Company, nor shall the Company be liable in any such case to any Holder Indemnified Party for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder Indemnified Party under an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnified Party expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided further, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder Indemnified Party from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased shares in the offering, if a copy of the prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnified Party to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the shares to such person, and if the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such party and shall survive the transfer of such securities.
(b) To the extent permitted by law, each Holder shall, if shares held by such Holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of - 15 -

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the Company under Section 2 above shall be subject to the condition that the Reviewing Party shall not have determined (in a written opinion, in any case in which the special independent counsel referred to in Section 7 hereof is the Reviewing Party) that the Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 6 below to secure a determination that the Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that the Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and the Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have lapsed).
The Indemnitee’s obligation to reimburse the Company for Expense Advances pursuant to this Section 5 shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.
If there has not been a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be selected by the Board, and if there has been such a Change in Control, other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company’s Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be the special independent counsel referred to in Section 7 hereof.6.
Enforcement of Indemnification Rights.
If the Reviewing Party determines that the Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law, or if the Indemnitee has not otherwise been paid in full pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 above within 10 business days after a written demand has been received by the Company, the Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in any court in the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper to recover the unpaid amount of the demand (an “Enforcement Proceeding”) and, if successful in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid any and all Expenses in connection with such Enforcement Proceeding.
The Company hereby consents to service of process for such Enforcement Proceeding and to appear in any such Enforcement Proceeding.
Any determination by the Reviewing Party not challenged by the Indemnitee shall be binding on the Company and Indemnitee.
The remedy provided for in this Section 6 shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Indemnitee at law or in equity.
(b) Defense to Indemnification, Burden of Proof, and Presumptions.
It shall be a defense to any action brought by Indemnitee against the Company to enforce this Agreement (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition) that it is not permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed.
In connection with any such action or any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of proving such a defense or determination shall be on the Company.
Neither the failure of the Reviewing Party or the Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action by Indemnitee that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct set forth in applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Reviewing Party or Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.For purposes of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) the termination of any Proceeding, action, suit, or claim, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law, and (2) Indemnitee shall be deemed, for purposes of any determination of good faith, to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee’s action is based on the records or books of account of the Company, including financial statements and regulatory reports, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Company in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or the Board or the Executive Committee or counsel selected by any committee of the Board or on information or records given or reports made to the Company by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser, investment banker or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or the Board or the Executive Committee or any committee of the Board.
The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, Executive Committee member, officer, agent or employee of the Company or other covered enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.The provisions of this Section 6(b) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.7.
Change in Control.
The Company agrees that if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company’s Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), then with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from special independent counsel selected by the Indemnitee and approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Such special independent counsel shall not have 7
otherwise performed services for the Company or the Indemnitee, other than in connection with such indemnification matters, within the last five years.
Such independent counsel shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement.
Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and the Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.
The Company agrees to furnish a reasonable retainer to and pay the reasonable fees of the special independent counsel referred to above and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of special independent counsel pursuant to this Agreement.8.
Non-exclusivity.
The rights of the Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights the Indemnitee may have under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.9.
Liability Insurance.
To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, the Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee with the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company’s directors or officers.10.
Settlement of Claims.
The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding effected without the Company’s written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that if a Change in Control has occurred (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the directors on the Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), the Company shall be liable for indemnification of Indemnitee for amounts paid in settlement and otherwise permitted hereunder and not prohibited by any applicable law if the independent counsel referred to in Section 7 above has approved the settlement.
The Company shall not settle any action, suit or proceeding in any manner that would impose any fine or other penalty or obligation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s prior written consent.11.
Amendment of this Agreement.
No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.
No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless in the form of a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought, and no such waiver shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
Except as specifically provided herein, no failure to exercise or any delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall constitute a waiver thereof.
(a) The rights of the Indemnitee hereunder shall vest immediately and fully upon entry into this Agreement and shall remain fully vested after Indemnitee has ceased to be a director and/or Executive Committee member.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, executors, administrators and personal and legal representatives.
(b) The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
Contribution.
To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if, and to the extent, the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).
No Person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
Mutual Acknowledgment.
Both the Company and Indemnitee acknowledge that, in certain instances, Federal law or public policy may override applicable state law and prohibit the Company from indemnifying its directors, Executive Committee members and officers under this Agreement or otherwise.
For example, the Company and Indemnitee acknowledge that the SEC has taken the position that indemnification is not permissible for liabilities arising under certain Federal securities laws, and Federal legislation prohibits indemnification for certain ERISA violations.
Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that the Company has undertaken, or may be required in the future to undertake, with the SEC to submit the question of indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a determination of the Company’s right under public policy to indemnify Indemnitee, and any right to indemnification hereunder shall be subject to, and conditioned upon, any such required court determination.17.
Severability.
If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.18.
Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such State without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.
The Company and Indemnitee each hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of Delaware for all purposes in connection with any Proceeding which arises out of or relates to this Agreement and agree that any Proceeding instituted under this Agreement shall be commenced, prosecuted and continued only in the courts of the State of Delaware.19.
Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.20.

From and after the Expiration Date, this Warrant shall be null, void and of no further force or effect.2.
(a) The holder hereof may exercise this Warrant, in whole or in part, at the times and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 hereof, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the subscription form attached hereto duly executed) at the principal office of the Company, together with payment in the aggregate amount equal to the Warrant Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock being purchased.
Adjustment of Warrant Price and Number of Shares.
(a) The Warrant Price and the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the happening of certain events occurring after the original issuance date, as follows:(i) Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger.
In case of any reclassification or change of outstanding Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), or in case of any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Company (other than a merger with another corporation in which the Company is the surviving corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination of outstanding Common Stock issuable upon such conversion) the rights of the holders of this Warrant shall be adjusted in the manner described below:(1) In the event that the Company is the surviving corporation, the Warrant shall, without payment of additional consideration therefor, be deemed modified so as to provide that upon exercise thereof the holder of this Warrant shall procure, in lieu of each share of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon such exercise, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation or merger by the holder of each share of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise had exercise occurred immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation or merger.
This Warrant (as adjusted) shall be deemed to provide for further adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 3.
The provisions of this clause (1) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations and mergers.
(2) In the event that the Company is not the surviving entity, the surviving entity shall, without payment of any additional consideration therefor, issue new Warrants, providing that upon exercise thereof the holder thereof shall procure in lieu of each share of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of this Warrant the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation or merger by the holder of each share of Common Stock issuable upon - 3 -
Such new Warrants shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 3.
The provisions of this clause (2) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations and mergers.
The Company shall not enter into any transaction subject to the provisions of this Section 3(a)(i)(2) unless the surviving entity in such transaction agrees in writing to issue new Warrants in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 3(a)(i)(2) and comply with the terms and conditions of such new Warrants.
(ii) Subdivision or Combination of Shares.
If the Company, at any time while any of this Warrant is outstanding, shall subdivide or combine its Common Stock, the Warrant Price shall be proportionately reduced, in case of subdivision of shares, as of the effective date of such subdivision, or shall be proportionately increased, in the case of combination of shares, as of the effective date of such combination.
In the event that a record date is set with respect to any such subdivision, and this Warrant is exercised after such record date but prior to the effective date of such subdivision, upon the effectiveness of such subdivision, the Company shall issue the Holder additional shares of Common Stock as if the Common Stock issued upon such exercise of the Warrant were outstanding on the record date with respect to such subdivision, without the payment of any additional consideration.
(iii) Certain Dividends and Distributions.
If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights to purchase stock, warrants, options, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of Common Stock (the “Purchase Rights”), then the Holder of this Warrant shall be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.
Upon each adjustment in the Warrant Price pursuant to any provision of this Section 3(a), the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise hereof shall be adjusted, to the nearest one hundredth of a whole share, to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares issuable upon exercise hereof immediately prior to such adjustment in the Warrant Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Warrant Price immediately thereafter.
The foregoing adjustment shall not constitute a waiver of any claim arising against the Company by reason of its default under the agreement contained in the last sentence of Section 4(a) of this Warrant.
Covenants.
(a) The Company covenants and agrees that all shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of this Warrant will, upon issuance, be fully paid and nonassessable and free from preemptive rights and any liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of this Warrant, free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, hypothecations, claims, charges, security interests, encumbrances, adverse - 6 -

(b) The Holder of this Warrant, by the acceptance hereof, represents that it is acquiring this Warrant, and upon exercise hereof will acquire the Warrant and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise hereof (collectively, including this Warrant, the “Warrant Securities”), for its own account and not with a view towards, or for resale in connection with, the public sale or distribution of the Warrant Securities, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.

The Holder further agrees, by acceptance of this Warrant that it will not offer or sell this Warrant or any shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise hereof in the absence of an effective registration statement for the Warrant or such shares of Common Stock, as applicable, under the Securities Act and such state or other laws as may be applicable, or receipt by the Company of a written opinion of counsel (provided that such counsel, and the form and substance of such opinion are reasonably satisfactory to the Company) that such registration is not required; provided, however that no such opinion shall be required in connection with (i) a transaction pursuant to Rule 144 in which the Holder provides the Company with certifications reasonably requested by the Company regarding compliance with the terms and provisions of Rule 144 or (ii) a distribution of any Warrant Securities to an Affiliate of the Holder, so long as such Affiliate does not pay any consideration in connection with such distribution (other than issuance of equity interests in such Affiliate) and the Holder provides the Company with certifications reasonably requested by the Company in connection therewith.
Furthermore, it is agreed that each Warrant and any shares of Common Stock will include the appropriate variant of the following legend:[THE SHARES OF STOCK EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE] [THIS WARRANT HAS] NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF ANY STATE.
