The Company shall not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Required Holders, including by way of a Fundamental Transaction (unless the Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing Fundamental Transactions set forth in the Notes and the Warrants).
A Buyer may assign some or all of its rights hereunder without the consent of the Company, in which event such assignee shall be deemed to be a Buyer hereunder with respect to such assigned rights.
This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person, except that each Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce the obligations of the Company with respect to Section 9(k).
Each Buyer shall be responsible only for its own representations, warranties, agreements and covenants hereunder.
To the extent that the foregoing undertaking by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities that is permissible under applicable law.
Legal counsel referred to in the immediately preceding sentence shall be selected by the Buyers holding at least a majority of the Securities issued and issuable hereunder.
The Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or Indemnified Liabilities by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Indemnitee that relates to such action or Indemnified Liabilities.
The indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnitee fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.
No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent.
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect to such Indemnified Liabilities or litigation, (ii) requires any admission of wrongdoing by such Indemnitee, or (iii) obligates or requires an Indemnitee to take, or refrain from taking, any action.
Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.
 (iii) The indemnification required by this Section 9(k) shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Liabilities are incurred.
(iv) The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (x) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnitee against the indemnifying party or others, and (y) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.
The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party.
Each Buyer and each holder of the Securities shall have all rights and remedies set forth in the Transaction Documents and all rights and remedies which such holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the rights which such holders have under any law.
Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law.
Furthermore, the Company recognizes that in the event that it fails to perform, observe, or discharge any or all of its obligations under the Transaction Documents, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Buyers.
The Company therefore agrees that the Buyers shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting a bond or other security.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of) the Transaction Documents, whenever any Buyer exercises a right, election, demand or option under a Transaction Document and the Company does not timely perform its related obligations within the periods therein provided, then such Buyer may rescind or withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to the Company, any relevant notice, demand or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and rights.
To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to the Buyers hereunder or pursuant to any of the other Transaction Documents or the Buyers enforce or exercise their rights hereunder or thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, foreign, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
The obligations of each Buyer under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Buyer, and no Buyer shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Buyer under any Transaction Document.
Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Buyer pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Buyers as, and the Company acknowledges that the Buyers do not so constitute, a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Buyers are in any way acting in concert or as a group, and the Company shall not assert any such claim with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and the Company acknowledges that the Buyers are not acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
The Company acknowledges and each Buyer confirms that it has independently participated in the negotiation of the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its own counsel and advisors.
Each Buyer shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of any other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Buyer to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

ANY TRANSFEREE OF THIS NOTE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THIS NOTE, INCLUDING SECTIONS 3(c)(iii) AND 19(a) HEREOF.
THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT REPRESENTED BY THIS NOTE AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION HEREOF MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS SET FORTH ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 3(c)(iii) OF THIS NOTE.
This Subordinated Convertible Note (including all Subordinated Convertible Notes issued in exchange, transfer or replacement hereof, this "Note") is one of an issue of Subordinated Convertible Notes issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement on the Closing Date (collectively, the "Notes" and such other Subordinated Convertible Notes, the "Other Notes").
Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in Section 32.
The "Maturity Date" shall be May [  ], 20181 Other than as specifically permitted by this Note, the Company may not prepay or redeem any portion of the outstanding Principal, accrued and unpaid Interest or accrued and unpaid Late Charges on Principal and Interest, if any.
This Note shall not bear any ordinary interest.
At any time or times after the date set out above as the Issuance Date (the "Issuance Date"), this Note shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3.
Subject to the provisions of Section 3(d), at any time or times on or after the Issuance Date, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(c), at the Conversion Rate (as defined below).
The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion.
If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share.
The Company shall pay any and all transfer, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of any Conversion Amount.
The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Conversion Amount pursuant to Section 3(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) such Conversion Amount by (y) the Conversion Price (the "Conversion Rate").
For the avoidance of doubt, all such foregoing determinations to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction during the applicable calculation period.
No ink-original Conversion Notice shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Conversion Notice be required.
The Company shall maintain a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the holders of each Note and the Principal amount of the Notes (and stated interest thereon) held by such holders (the "Registered Notes").
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.
The Company and the holders of the Notes shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Note for all purposes, including, without limitation, the right to receive payments of Principal and Interest, if any, hereunder, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
A Registered Note may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register.
Upon its receipt of a request to assign or sell all or part of any Registered Note by the Holder, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Notes in the same aggregate Principal amount as the Principal amount of the surrendered Registered Note to the designated assignee or transferee pursuant to Section 18.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of this Note upon physical surrender of this Note.
The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal, Interest and Late Charges, if any, converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion.
In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from the Holder of this Note and one or more holders of Other Notes for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such portions of this Note and the Other Notes submitted for conversion, the Company, subject to Section 3(d), shall convert from the Holder and each holder of Other Notes electing to have this Note or the Other Notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of the Note and its Other Notes submitted for conversion based on the Principal amount of this Note and the Other Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate Principal amount of this Note and all Other Notes submitted for conversion on such date.
 (d)   Beneficial Ownership.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not effect the conversion of any portion of this Note, and the Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Note and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder together with the other Attribution Parties whose identities and beneficial ownership of Common Stock have been made known to the Company, collectively would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (the "Maximum Percentage") of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and the other Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by the Holder and all other Attribution Parties plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the Other Notes and Warrants) beneficially owned by the Holder or any other Attribution Party subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 3(d).
For purposes of this Section 3(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock the Holder may acquire upon the conversion of the Note without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (i) the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (iii) any other written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the "Reported Outstanding Share Number").
In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported.
In the event that the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Holder upon conversion of this Note results in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), the number of shares so issued by which the Holder's and the other Attribution Parties' aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the "Excess Shares") shall be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and the Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess Shares.
For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of this Note in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Holder for any purpose including for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.
The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 3(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 3(d) or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.
The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of this Note.
(a)    This Note will be subordinate and junior to the Company’s Senior Indebtedness.
The Company for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees and the Holder of this Note, for itself, its successors and assigns, by its acceptance of this Note likewise covenants and agrees that, to the extent provided below, the payment of all amounts due pursuant to this Note is hereby expressly subordinated and junior in right of payment to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, to the Company’s Senior Indebtedness.
A Blockage Event shall not be deemed to have existed during the period of time commencing on the date upon which the holder of this Note accelerates payment of the principal amount of this Note or such other Notes as a result of any Event of Default hereunder and ending on the 365th day after written notice of such acceleration given by the holder or such other holders to the Company and the holders of the instruments evidencing the Senior Indebtedness; provided that in no event shall the Company pay the holder of this Note or the holders of any other Notes the principal amount so accelerated if a Blockage Event then exists until the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full.
(f)    No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination provisions of this obligation shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or the Holder or by their failure to comply with this Note or any other agreement or document evidencing, related to or securing the obligations hereunder.
Without in any way limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Holder, without incurring responsibility to the Holder and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Note or the obligations of the Holder to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment of any Senior Indebtedness provided that such change does not materially impact Holder in an adverse manner; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing any Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any person or entity liable in any manner for the collection of any Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or any other person or entity.
For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to holders of such Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holder would be entitled except for the provisions of this Section and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Section to holders of such Senior Indebtedness by the Holder, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Indebtedness, and the Holder, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of this Section are solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, on the one hand and the Holder, on the other hand.
If, in or as a result of any action case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended from time to time, or any comparable statute, relating to the Company, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness return, refund or repay to the Company, or any trustee or committee appointed in such case or proceeding receive any payment or proceeds of any collateral in connection with such action, case or proceeding alleging that the receipt of such payments or proceeds by the holders of the Senior Indebtedness was a transfer voidable under state or federal law, then the holders of the Senior Indebtedness shall not be deemed ever to have received such payments or proceeds for purposes of this Note in determining whether and when all Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full and the Company shall pay or cause to be paid, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive any such funds, proceeds or collateral to satisfy all amounts due hereunder.
In the event the holders of Senior Indebtedness receive amounts in excess of payment in full (cash) of amounts outstanding in respect of Senior Indebtedness (without giving effect to whether claims in respect of the Senior Indebtedness are allowed in any insolvency proceeding), the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall pay such excess amounts to the Holder.
Redemptions required by this Section 5(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.
To the extent redemptions required by this Section 5(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Note by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5, but subject to Section 3(d), until the Event of Default Redemption Price (together with any interest thereon) is paid in full, the Conversion Amount submitted for redemption under this Section 5(b) (together with any interest thereon) may be converted, in whole or in part, by the Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the right of the Holder to require redemption of all or a portion of this Note is subject to the subordination provisions of Section 4 hereof.
RIGHTS UPON FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTION AND CHANGE OF CONTROL.
 of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Note) prior to such Fundamental Transaction (such corresponding number of shares of Successor Capital Stock to be delivered to the Holder shall equal the greater of (I) the quotient of (A) the aggregate dollar value of all consideration (including cash consideration and any consideration other than cash ("Non-Cash Consideration"), in such Fundamental Transaction, as such values are set forth in any definitive agreement for the Fundamental Transaction that has been executed at the time of the first public announcement of the Fundamental Transaction or, if no such value is determinable from such definitive agreement, as determined in accordance with Section 24 with the term "Non-Cash Consideration" being substituted for the term "Conversion Price") that the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Fundamental Transaction, had this Note been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Note) (the "Aggregate Consideration") divided by (B) the per share Closing Sale Price of such Successor Capital Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the consummation or occurrence of the Fundamental Transaction and (II) the product of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate Consideration, by (y) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the consummation or occurrence of the Fundamental Transaction and (B) the highest exchange ratio pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company may exchange Common Stock for Successor Capital Stock) (provided, however, to the extent that the Holder's right to receive any such shares of publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity would result in the Holder and its other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, if applicable, then the Holder shall not be entitled to receive such shares to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity as a result of such consideration to such extent) and the portion of such shares shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time or times, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder and its other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be delivered such shares to the extent as if there had been no such limitation), and such security shall be satisfactory to the Holder, and with an identical conversion price to the Conversion Price hereunder (such adjustments to the number of shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting after the consummation or occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction the economic value of this Note that was in effect immediately prior to the consummation or occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, as elected by the Holder solely at its option).
The provisions of this Section 6(a) shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions.
Redemptions required by this Section 6 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 and shall have priority to payments to shareholders in connection with a Change of Control, but shall be subject to the subordination provisions of Section 4 hereof.
To the extent redemptions required by this Section 6(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Note by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6, but subject to Section 3(d), until the Change of Control Redemption Price (together with any interest thereon) is paid in full, the Conversion Amount submitted for redemption under this Section 6(b) (together with any interest thereon) may be converted, in whole or in part, by the Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.
(a)   Distribution of Assets.
If the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distributions of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to any or all holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property, Options, evidence of Indebtedness or any other assets by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (the "Distributions"), then the Holder will be entitled to such Distributions as if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for such Distribution or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for such Distributions (provided, however, that to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be granted such rights (and any rights under this Section 7(a) on such initial rights or on any subsequent such rights to be held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).
(b)   Purchase Rights.
If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "Purchase Rights"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, that to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right to be held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).
In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the occurrence or consummation of any Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities, cash, assets or other property with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a "Corporate Event"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that, and any applicable Successor Entity or Successor Entities shall ensure that, the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note at any time after the occurrence or consummation of the Corporate Event, shares of Common Stock or Successor Capital Stock or, if so elected by the Holder, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) purchasable upon the conversion of this Note prior to such Corporate Event (but not in lieu of such items still issuable under Sections 7(a) and 7(b), which shall continue to be receivable on the Common Stock or on such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other property otherwise receivable with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock), such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other property whatsoever (including warrants or other purchase or subscription rights and any shares of Common Stock) which the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence or consummation of such Corporate Event or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Corporate Event, had this Note been converted immediately prior to such Corporate Event or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Corporate Event (without regard to any limitations on conversion of this Note).
Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders.
The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events.
If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Fixed Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced.
If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Fixed Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased.
The portion of this Note and the Other Notes subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 9(a) shall be redeemed by the Company on the applicable Company Optional Redemption Date (as defined below) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to wire instructions provided by the Holder in (a "Company Optional Redemption Price").
Each Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9, until the applicable Company Optional Redemption Price is paid in full, such Company Optional Redemption Amount may be converted, subject to Section 3(d), in whole or in part, by the Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.
Company Optional Redemptions made pursuant to this Section 9 shall be made in accordance with Section 13.
To the extent redemptions required by this Section 9 are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Note by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments.
If the Company elects to cause a Company Optional Redemption pursuant to Section 9(a), then it must simultaneously take the same action in the same proportion with respect to the Other Notes.
The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Note, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note.
(a)   Reservation.
The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock for each of this Note and the Other Notes equal to 150% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note as of the Issuance Date.
So long as any of this Note and the Other Notes are outstanding, the Company shall take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of this Note and the Other Notes, the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes then outstanding; provided, that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved pursuant hereto (in each case, without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "Required Reserve Amount").
The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of this Note and the Other Notes and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the Holder and the holders of the Other Notes based on the Principal amount of this Note and the Other Notes held by each holder at the Closing (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "Authorized Share Allocation").
Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the Holder and the remaining holders of Other Notes, pro rata based on the Principal amount of this Note and the Other Notes then held by such holders.
If at any time while any of the Notes remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "Authorized Share Failure"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes then outstanding.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than seventy-five (75) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall either (x) obtain the written consent of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock and provide each shareholder with an information statement with respect thereto or (y) hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

If the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to any or all holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property, options, evidence of indebtedness or any other assets by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a "Distribution"), at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations or restrictions on exercise of this Warrant, including without limitation, the Maximum Percentage) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution (provided, however, that to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be granted such Distribution (and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).
In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 2 above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "Purchase Rights"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations or restrictions on exercise of this Warrant, including without limitation, the Maximum Percentage) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, that to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).
The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Warrant and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (i) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, (ii) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of this Warrant, and (iii) shall, so long as any of the SPA Warrants are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the exercise of the SPA Warrants, the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the exercise of the SPA Warrants then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on exercise).
·                 WARRANT HOLDER NOT DEEMED A SHAREHOLDER.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Holder, solely in such Person's capacity as a holder of this Warrant, shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of share capital of the Company for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Warrant be construed to confer upon the Holder, solely in such Person's capacity as the Holder of this Warrant, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether any reorganization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise), receive notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, prior to the issuance to the Holder of the Warrant Shares which such Person is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this Warrant.
In addition, nothing contained in this Warrant shall be construed as imposing any liabilities on the Holder to purchase any securities (upon exercise of this Warrant or otherwise) or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liabilities are asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.
Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Warrant.
Exchangeable for Multiple Warrants.
This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the Holder at the principal office of the Company, for a new Warrant or Warrants (in accordance with Section 7(d)) representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant, and each such new Warrant will represent the right to purchase such portion of such Warrant Shares as is designated by the Holder at the time of such surrender; provided, however, that no SPA Warrants for fractional Warrant Shares shall be given.
Issuance of New Warrants.
Whenever the Company is required to issue a new Warrant pursuant to the terms of this Warrant, such new Warrant (i) shall be of like tenor with this Warrant, (ii) shall represent, as indicated on the face of such new Warrant, the right to purchase the Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant (or in the case of a new Warrant being issued pursuant to Section 7(a) or Section 7(c), the Warrant Shares designated by the Holder which, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the other new Warrants issued in connection with such issuance, does not exceed the number of Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant), (iii) shall have an issuance date, as indicated on the face of such new Warrant which is the same as the Issuance Date, and (iv) shall have the same rights and conditions as this Warrant.
 ·                 NOTICES.
It is expressly understood and agreed that the time of exercise specified by the Holder in each Exercise Notice shall be definitive and may not be disputed or challenged by the Company.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Warrant may be amended or waived and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company has obtained the written consent of the Required Holders.
Any change, amendment or waiver by the Company and the Required Holders shall be binding on the Holder of this Warrant and all holders of the other SPA Warrants.
This Warrant shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of this Warrant shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of New York.
The Company hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in The City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper.
The Company hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address set forth in Section 9(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or taking other legal action against the Company in any other jurisdiction to collect on the Company's obligations to the Holder, to realize on any collateral or any other security for such obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other court ruling in favor of the Holder.
THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS WARRANT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
This Warrant shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and all the Buyers and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof.
The headings of this Warrant are for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Warrant.
In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price or the arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares, the Company shall submit the disputed determinations or arithmetic calculations via facsimile or electronic mail within one (1) Business Day of receipt of the Exercise Notice giving rise to such dispute, as the case may be, to the Holder.
Such investment bank's or accountant's determination or calculation, as the case may be, shall be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error.
 ·                 REMEDIES, OTHER OBLIGATIONS, BREACHES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
The remedies provided in this Warrant shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall limit the right of the Holder to pursue actual damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Warrant.
The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate.
The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the holder of this Warrant shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.
This Warrant and the Warrant Shares may be offered for sale, sold, transferred, pledged or assigned without the consent of the Company, except as may otherwise be required by Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement.
If any provision of this Warrant is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Warrant so long as this Warrant as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties.
The parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s) with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s).
