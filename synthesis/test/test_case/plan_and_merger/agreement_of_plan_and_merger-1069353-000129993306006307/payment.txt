(e) If the Stockholder Loan is made, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Contribution Amount shall be equal to the excess (if any) of (i) $20,000,000 over (ii) the Stockholder Loan Amount.
To the extent that at any time a proposed repayment by Parent of all or any portion of the principal amount of a Stockholder Loan (other than by reason of a Distribution Entitlement) would have the effect of reducing the aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Stockholder Loans remaining below an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (A) $20 million over (B) the aggregate amount of all of all prior reductions in the principal amount of Stockholder Loans as a result of Distribution Entitlements, the amount of such repayment shall not be paid by Parent to the payees of the Stockholder Loan, but instead shall be deposited in the Indemnity Escrow Fund; provided, however, that the principal amount of the Stockholder Loan shall for all purposes be deemed to have been reduced by the amount of such deposit.
Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall establish a pool of options to acquire 4,698,692 shares of Parent’s common stock, a portion of which shall be subject to issuance to members of management and other selected employees of the Acquired Companies, as determined by the Parent in its sole discretion.
The Company understands that Parent is a blank check company formed for the purpose of consummating a “business combination” (as described in the Prospectus), must complete such business combination within 18 months (or 24 months if a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement has been executed within 18 months) (the “Transaction Deadline Date”), has established a trust account at Lehman Brothers, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, initially in an amount of $164,308,004 after the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option for the benefit of its public stockholders (the “Trust Account”), and does not have access to the funds in such Trust Account except under the circumstances set forth in the Prospectus.
6.7 Dissenting Shares.
6.14 Financing.
Parent and Merger Sub shall have received (or be receiving contemporaneously with the Closing) financing in an amount equal to $35,000,000 (including any undrawn amounts thereunder) on the terms and conditions set forth in the Wachovia Commitment Letter.
At such time as the cumulative amount of such Damages exceeds $1,700,000 in the aggregate, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the entire amount of such Damages, including the initial $1,700,000.
At such time as the cumulative amount of such Damages exceeds $1,700,000 in the aggregate, the Company Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the entire amount of such Damages, including the initial $1,700,000.
(iii) if such Damages are greater than $275,000 with respect to any event or occurrence or series of related events or occurrences relating to the same customer or supplier, the amount of such Damages shall for all purposes of this Agreement be deemed to be an amount equal to (x) $123,750 plus (y) 70% of the amount of such Damages in excess of $275,000.
If, at any time after the Designated Date, such Indemnitee receives any Net Alternative Recovery Amount with respect to such insurance claim or claim against such Specified Third Party, such Indemnitee shall pay any portion of such Net Alternative Recovery Amount that would have reduced the amount of Damages recoverable by such Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund (x) to the extent of the excess (if any) of (1) the aggregate amount of the Claimed Amounts and Contested Amounts, as the case may be, associated with all remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims as of such date, over (2) the Aggregate Escrow Balance (as defined in Section 9.7(i)) as of such date, back to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and (y) otherwise to the Stockholders’ Representative for distribution to the Escrow Participants.
(ii) if the Indemnitee is a Company Indemnitee, Parent shall pay to the Company Indemnitee, in cash, an amount equal to the full Claimed Amount.
(ii) if the Indemnitee is a Company Indemnitee, Parent shall pay to the Company Indemnitee, in cash, an amount equal to the Agreed Amount.
(ii) if the Indemnitee is a Company Indemnitee, Parent shall pay to the Company Indemnitee, in cash, an amount equal to the Stipulated Amount.
(ii) if the Indemnitee is a Company Indemnitee, Parent shall pay to the Company Indemnitee, in cash, an amount equal to the Award Amount.
If the sum of the aggregate amount of all distributions made from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to any Parent Indemnitee on or prior to the Initial Release Date plus the aggregate amount of all Claimed Amounts or Contested Amounts, as the case may be, associated with all indemnification claims made by Parent Indemnitees that have not been finally resolved and paid on or prior to the Initial Release Date (each such indemnification claim being referred to as an “Unresolved Claim”) is less than $7,000,000 (the amount of such shortfall being referred to as the “Aggregate Initial Distribution Amount”), then within five business days after receipt of such written notice, Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, directing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to each Escrow Participant, with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of Company Common Stock subject to an In-the-Money Company Option held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying the Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock or such share of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option by the Aggregate Initial Distribution Amount.
In no event shall the aggregate amount of the Aggregate Initial Distribution Amount and any additional amounts distributed pursuant to this clause (h) exceed $7,000,000.
(d) Any Taxes of the Acquired Companies that (i) are paid by the Acquired Companies on or before the Closing Date, (ii) were accrued as a liability of the Acquired Companies in the computation of the Closing Working Capital Amount or (iii) are paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnitees under Section 9.2(a) hereof and are either later refunded to an Acquired Company or credited against a Tax liability of an Acquired Company or any of the Acquired Companies’ Affiliates shall, together with any interest paid by the Governmental Body with respect to such refund or credit, promptly be paid over to the Stockholders’ Representative for distribution to the Escrow Participants pro rata in accordance with their respective Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fractions; provided, however, that in the case of clause (iii) above, Parent shall pay an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such refund, credit and/or interest (x) to the extent of the excess (if any) of (1) the aggregate amount of the Claimed Amounts and Contested Amounts, as the case may be, associated with all remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims as of such date, over (2) the Aggregate Escrow Balance as of such date, back to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and (y) otherwise to the Stockholders’ Representative for distribution to the Escrow Participants pro rata in accordance with their respective Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fractions.
Upon any release of funds by the Stockholders’ Representative from the Stockholders’ Representative Expense Fund, (other than to cover expenses of the Stockholders’ Representative as set forth above), the Stockholders’ Representative shall release to each Escrow Participant, with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of Company Common Stock subject to an In-the-Money Company Option held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying the Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock or such share of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option by the amount of funds to be released from the Stockholders’ Representative Expense Fund.
