(f) If (i) an Indemnitor obtains a bona fide, good faith, written offer from a third-party claimant to settle in all respects a Legal Proceeding being defended by such Indemnitor pursuant to Section 9.5(a) in exchange solely for a cash payment specified in such written offer, all of which would be paid or otherwise borne by the Indemnitor (the “Specified Settlement Amount”) and a release of claims against such third party (a “Release of Claims”), and such settlement offer is subject to no requirements, obligations or limitations on the part of the Indemnitee or imposed on the Indemnitee or its business other than the obligation to provide a Release of Claims, (ii) such Indemnitor requests in writing the written consent of the Indemnitee to such settlement in accordance with Section 9.5(a)(E), and (iii) the Indemnitee refuses in writing to consent to such settlement or otherwise fails to consent to such settlement within 15 business days after its receipt of such written request, thereafter the maximum liability of the Indemnitor for the matters arising out of such Legal Proceeding shall be, subject to the other provisions of this Section 9.3, the Specified Settlement Amount.
(g) In the event that the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five business days prior to the date of the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting of any material error identified in the financial statements of the Company or other information provided by the Company, in either case that are included in the preliminary Proxy Statement or in the definitive Proxy Statement mailed to Parent’s stockholders, and Parent nevertheless determines that it is not necessary to or otherwise refuses or fails to modify such preliminary Proxy Statement or, in the case that the definitive Proxy Statement that has been mailed to the stockholders of Parent, to mail a supplement or amendment to Parent’s stockholders, Parent shall have no recourse to the Indemnity Escrow Fund or otherwise for any Damages resulting from any Legal Proceeding brought by or on behalf of Parent’s stockholders to the extent such Legal Proceeding is based upon the error identified by the Company.
(a) If any Indemnitee has incurred or suffered or claims to have incurred or suffered, or believes that it may incur or suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under this Section 9, such Indemnitee may deliver a notice to the Indemnitor (any such notice being referred to as a “Notice of Indemnification Claim,” and the claim for indemnification, compensation and reimbursement described in such Notice of Indemnification Claim being referred to as an “indemnification claim”), which shall: (i) state that such Indemnitee believes that that there is or has been an inaccuracy in or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement or that such Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under this Section 9; (ii) contain a brief description of the circumstances supporting such Indemnitee’s belief that there is or has been such an inaccuracy or breach or that such Indemnitee may otherwise be entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed; and (iii) contain a good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of actual and potential Damages that have arisen and may arise as a result of the inaccuracy, breach or other matter referred to in such notice (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by such Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to as the “Claimed Amount”).
(b) During the 30-day period (the “Dispute Period”) commencing upon (i) the delivery by an Indemnitee to the Indemnitor of a Notice of Indemnification Claim or (ii) if such Notice of Indemnification Claim relates to a third party claim or Legal Proceeding, the final resolution or settlement of such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Indemnitor shall deliver to the Indemnitee a written response (the “Response Notice”) in which the Indemnitor: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part (but not all) of the Claimed Amount (the “Agreed Amount”) is owed to the Indemnitee; or (iii) asserts that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee.
(c) If the Indemnitor delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, or if the Indemnitor does not deliver a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during the Dispute Period, then, within three days following the earlier of the delivery of such Response Notice to the Indemnitee or the expiration of the Dispute Period:
(i) if the Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnitee, Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the full Claimed Amount to the Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund; and
(d) If the Indemnitor delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during the Dispute Period agreeing that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, then, within three days following the delivery of such Response Notice to the Indemnitee:
(i) if the Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnitee, Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Agreed Amount to the Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund; and
(e) If the Indemnitor delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during the Dispute Period indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount.
If the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor resolve such dispute in writing, then their resolution of such dispute shall be binding on the Indemnitor, the Escrow Participants and the Indemnitee and a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to the Indemnitee (the “Stipulated Amount”) shall be signed by the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor.
(i) if the Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnitee, then Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Stipulated Amount to the Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund; and
The final decision of the arbitrator shall include the dollar amount of the award to the Indemnitee, if any (the “Award Amount”), and shall be furnished in writing to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee and, if the Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent, shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issues in question, binding upon the Indemnitor, the former holders of Company Capital Stock and In-the-Money Company Options and the Indemnitee.
Within three days following the receipt of the final award of the arbitrator setting forth the Award Amount:
(i) if the Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnitee, Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Award Amount to the Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund; and
(g) Within five business days after the date that Parent receives the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, together with the final audit report thereto signed by the Company’s outside auditor (the “Initial Release Date”), Parent shall notify the Stockholders’ Representative in writing of such receipt.
(h) Following the Initial Release Date, upon the final resolution of any indemnification claim that was an Unresolved Claim on the Initial Release Date, if the final amount for which the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification with respect to such Unresolved Claim is less than the amount of such Unresolved Claim used for purposes of determining the Aggregate Initial Distribution Amount, Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, directing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Escrow Participants, in the respective proportions set forth in Section 9.7(g), any portion of such amount that would have been distributed to the Escrow Participants as part of such Aggregate Initial Distribution Amount if such Unresolved Claim had been resolved, and any Damages with respect thereto had been distributed from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to any Parent Indemnitee, prior to the Initial Distribution Date, taking into account other indemnification claims that were Unresolved Claims on the Initial Release Date and continue to be outstanding on the date of such final resolution.
(i) If the aggregate amount of cash remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (the “Aggregate Escrow Balance”) as of the Designated Date exceeds the aggregate dollar amount, as of the Designated Date, of the Claimed Amounts and Contested Amounts associated with all indemnification claims made by Parent Indemnitees that have not been finally resolved and paid prior to the Designated Date in accordance with this Section 9.7 (each, an “Unresolved Escrow Claim”) (the amount of such excess being referred to as the “Aggregate Second Distribution Amount”), then within five business days after the Designated Date, Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to each Escrow Participant, with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of Company Common Stock subject to an In-the-Money Company Option held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying the Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock or such share of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option by the Aggregate Second Distribution Amount.
(j) Following the Designated Date, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is finally resolved, Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days after the final resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim and the payment to the Parent Indemnitee of all amounts payable to the Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund with respect thereto, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to each Escrow Participant, with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of Company Common Stock subject to an In-the-Money Company Option held by such Escrow Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying the Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock or such share of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option by the amount (if any) by which the Aggregate Escrow Balance as of such date exceeds the aggregate amount of the Claimed Amounts and Contested Amounts, as the case may be, associated with all remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims.
(b) Parent and the Acquired Companies shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods not yet filed or due to be filed as of the Closing Date (giving effect to extensions).
Parent and the Acquired Companies shall prepare all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for all Tax periods that begin after the Closing Date (a “Post-Closing Tax Period”) and all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for all Tax periods that begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a “Straddle Period”).
Parent and the Acquired Companies shall provide the Stockholders’ Representative with drafts of all Tax Returns prepared by Parent or the Acquired Companies at least 15 business days prior to the filing date thereof, but only to the extent such Tax Returns are for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period or would constitute an amendment to Tax Returns previously filed by the Stockholders’ Representative or the Acquired Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Parent shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to make available to the Stockholders’ Representative and its accountants any relevant work papers of the Surviving Corporation and its accountants generated in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and or Straddle Period and shall provide the Stockholders’ Representative and its accountants with access to the records and employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (and make appropriate personnel available during reasonable business hours) to the extent reasonably necessary to for the Stockholders’ Representative to review and evaluate such Tax Returns.
(e) Parent or the Acquired Companies shall promptly notify the Stockholders’ Representative in writing upon receipt by any Acquired Company of a written notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments for which a Parent Indemnitee may have a right to indemnification under Section 9.2 hereof (“Tax Contest Claims”).
(b) The Escrow Participants (by virtue of their adoption of this Agreement) grant to the Stockholders’ Representative full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of the Escrow Participants (in the name of any or all of the Escrow Participants or otherwise) any and all documents that the Stockholders’ Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such provisions as the Stockholders’ Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as contemplated by Section 10.1(a).
If the Stockholders’ Representative shall resign or otherwise become unable to fulfill its responsibilities under this Section 10.1 or cease to function in its capacity as Stockholders’ Representative for any reason whatsoever, then Escrow Participants collectively holding greater than a 50% interest in the cash held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall, within 30 days thereof, appoint a successor and, promptly thereafter, shall notify Parent and the Escrow Agent of the identity of such successor.
(g) In the event that the Stockholders’ Representative shall expend amounts in excess of the Stockholders’ Representative Expense Fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 10.1, the Stockholders’ Representative shall be entitled deliver to Parent written notice certifying the amount of such expenses in excess of the Stockholders’ Representative Expense Fund payable by the Stockholders (an “Excess Expenses Certificate”).
Following receipt by Parent of an Excess Expenses Certificate, prior to the distribution of any funds to Escrow Participants from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, Parent shall reimburse the amount certified in the Excess Expenses Certificate to the Stockholders’ Representative (up to the amount of funds otherwise to be distributed from the Indemnity Escrow Fund) and shall deduct a corresponding amount from such amount otherwise to be distributed.
Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any of the Contemplated Transactions.
