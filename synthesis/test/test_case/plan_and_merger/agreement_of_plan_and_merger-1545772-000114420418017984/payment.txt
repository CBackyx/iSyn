If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Factor shall be decreased, effective as of the date the BPY GP determines not to issue such rights, options or warrants, to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such issuance had not occurred.In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle holders of BPY Units to subscribe for or to purchase or to otherwise acquire BPY Units (or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for BPY Units) at a price per unit that is less than the average of the BPY Unit Value of a BPY Unit for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the minimum aggregate purchase price under such BPY Distributed Rights, there shall be taken into 6
(3) (A) BPY shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of BPY Units evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding all dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash, dividends and distributions referred to in subsection (1) or (2) above or any Spin-off referred to in clause 3(B) below) or rights, options or warrants to convert into, exchange for or subscribe for or to purchase or to otherwise acquire such securities, then the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted to equal the amount determined by multiplying the Conversion Factor in effect immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Record Date by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the average of the BPY Unit Value of a BPY Unit over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately prior to the Record Date and (b) the denominator of which shall be the average of the BPY Unit Value of a BPY Unit over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately prior to the Record Date less the fair market value on the Record Date (as determined by the BPY GP) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness or assets, rights, options or warrants so distributed applicable to one BPY Unit.Any adjustment made under this clause (3)(A) will become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Record Date for such distribution.
shall be the average of the BPY Unit Value of a BPY Unit over the Valuation Period; provided that, if the Corporation elects to pay cash in lieu of making an adjustment to the Conversion Factor provided by this clause 3(B), the Corporation shall be required to pay and the Class A Shareholders shall be entitled to receive, cash to the Class A Shareholders on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period in an amount calculated by multiplying the BPY Unit Value on the Record Date by the amount of the incremental increase in the Conversion Factor.Any adjustment pursuant to this clause (3)(B) will be made immediately after the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period, but will be given effect as of the Open of Business on the Record Date for such Spin-off.
(4) BPY pays any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of BPY Units in excess of any cash dividend or distribution the Corporation pays to all or substantially all Class A Shareholders during any calendar quarter, then the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Factor in effect immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Record Date by a fraction (a) the numerator of which is the BPY Unit Value of a BPY Unit on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date and (b) the denominator of which is the BPY Unit Value of a BPY Unit on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date less the Excess Cash for such quarter; provided, however, if and when the Class A Shareholders receive the full amount of the Class A Dividend for the current quarter and all prior periods, then the Conversion Factor shall be decreased to the Conversion Factor that would have been in effect had no Excess Cash been paid.Any adjustment under this clause (4) shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.
If no such excess is or will be actually paid to holders of BPY Units, the Conversion Factor shall be decreased, effective as of the date the BPY GP determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Excess Cash is equal to or greater than the BPY Unit Value of a BPY Unit on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, each Class A Shareholder shall receive from the Corporation out of funds legally available therefor, in respect of each share of Class A Stock, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the BPY Units, the Excess Cash that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of BPY Units equal to the Conversion Factor on the Record Date.
(5) BPY or one of its subsidiaries shall make a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for the BPY Units, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per BPY Unit exceeds the average of the BPY Unit Value over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the “Expiration Date”), then the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted to equal the amount determined by multiplying the Conversion Factor in effect immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Corporation) paid or payable for BPY Units purchased or exchanged in such tender or exchange offer plus the average of the BPY Unit Value over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date multiplied by the number of BPY Units issued and outstanding immediately after the Expiration Date (after giving effect to the purchase of all BPY Units accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer, without duplication), and (b) the denominator of which is the number of BPY Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Expiration Date (before giving effect to the purchase of the BPY Units accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer) multiplied by the average of the BPY Unit Value over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date.Any adjustment under this clause (5) will be made at the Close of Business on the tenth (10th) Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date and shall be given effect as of the Open of Business on the day next succeeding the Expiration Date.Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of any exchange during the Valuation Period, references above to “ten (10) consecutive Trading Days” shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Expiration Date and the Trading Day immediately preceding the Specified Exchange Date in determining the Conversion Factor.
(6) the Corporation (a) declares or pays a dividend on its outstanding Class A Stock wholly or partly in Class A Shares or makes a distribution to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding Class A Shares wholly or partly in Class A Shares; (b) splits or subdivides its outstanding Class A Shares or (c) effects a reverse stock split or otherwise combines or reclassifies its outstanding Class A Shares into a smaller number of Class A Shares, then the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Factor in effect prior to the Open of Business on the Record Date by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the actual number of Class A Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or Effective Date for such split, subdivision, reverse split combination or reclassification, as applicable, without taking into account such dividend, distribution, split subdivision, reverse split combination or reclassification, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares issued and 9
If such dividend or distribution of the type described in this clause (6) is declared but not so paid or made and will not be so paid or made, the Conversion Factor shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Factor that would be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared;(7) the Corporation distributes any rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all holders of its Class A Stock to subscribe for or to purchase or to otherwise acquire Class A Shares (or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for Class A Shares) at a price per share that is less than the average of the Class A Stock Value of a Class A Share for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance (each a “Class A Distributed Right”), then, as of the Record Date of such Class A Distributed Rights or, if later, the time such Class A Distributed Rights become exercisable, the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Factor in effect immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Record Date by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares issued and outstanding as of the Close of Business on the Record Date plus a fraction (x) the numerator of which is the minimum aggregate purchase price under such Class A Distributed Rights of the maximum number of Class A Shares deliverable or purchasable under such Class A Distributed Rights and (y) the denominator of which is the average of the Class A Stock Value of a Class A Share for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance (or, if later, the date such Class A Distributed Rights become exercisable) and (b) the denominator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares issued and outstanding as of the Close of Business on the Record Date (or, if later, the date such Class A Distributed Rights become exercisable) plus the maximum number of shares Class A Stock purchasable under such Class A Distributed Rights; provided, however, that, if any such Class A Distributed Rights expire or become no longer exercisable, then the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted, effective retroactive to the Record Date of the Class A Distributed Rights, to reflect a reduced maximum number of Class A Shares or any change in the minimum aggregate purchase price for the purposes of the above fraction.Any adjustment under this clause (7) will be successively made whenever such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Record Date for such issuance.
If such rights, options or warrants are not and will not be so issued, the Conversion Factor shall be increased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines not to issue such rights, options or warrants, to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such issuance had not occurred.In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle Class A Shareholders to subscribe for or to purchase or to otherwise acquire Class A Stock (or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for Class A Stock) at a price per share that is less than the average of the Class A Stock Value of a share of Class A Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the minimum aggregate purchase price of such shares of Class A Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors; andAny adjustment to the Conversion Factor shall be calculated up to four (4) decimal places.
The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is [Eleven Billion Five Hundred Million (11,500,000,000)] shares, consisting of (i) [Five Hundred Million (500,000,000)] shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Preferred Stock”), (ii) [             (            )] 16

The “Class A Dividend” shall mean cumulative dividends per share in a cash amount equal in value to (i) the amount of any dividend or other distribution made on a BPY Unit multiplied by (ii) the Conversion Factor in effect on the date of declaration of such dividend.
The dividends upon the Class A Shares shall, if and to the extent declared by the Board of Directors, be paid in arrears (without interest) on the dividend payment date with respect thereto.
