Payments and Contributions .
(c) The Liquidation Preference shall be the Stated Value of $1,000 per share of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock.
Subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions of this Paragraph 5, commencing on the earlier of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) or 90 days after the Original Issuance Date (as hereinafter defined), the holder of any shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert each such share of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (except that upon any liquidation of the Corporation, the right of conversion shall terminate at the close of business on the business day fixed for payment of the amount distributable on the Series H Convertible Preferred Stock) into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Stated Value of such share or shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock divided by (i) the lowest price at which a trade of the Common Stock is executed, as reported by Bloomberg L.P., on the principal market for the Corporation's Common Stock (the "Principal Market") during the period of five Trading Days ending with the last Trading Day prior to the date of conversion (the "Market Price"), after (ii) discounting the Market Price by 20% to determine the conversion price (the "Conversion Price").
To illustrate, if the Market Price as of the Conversion Date is $1.00 and 100 shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock are being converted, the Stated Value for which would be $100,000, then the Conversion Price shall be $0.80 per share of Common Stock, whereupon the Stated Value of $100,000 of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock would entitle the holder thereof to convert the 100 shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock into 125,000 shares of Common Stock ($100,000 divided by 0.80 equals 125,000).
However, in no event shall the Conversion Price be greater than 130% of the lowest price at which a trade of the Common Stock is executed, as reported by Bloomberg L.P. on the Principal Market during the period of five Trading Days ending with the last Trading Day prior to the Original Issuance Date (the "Maximum Conversion Price").The right of each holder to convert shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock is subject to the limitations set forth in Paragraph 5(b) below, and for the purpose of complying with the limitation set forth in Paragraph 5(b)(ii), shall be prorated among the original purchasers of the shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Initial Holders') and their subsequent transferees, if any, based upon the number of shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock purchased by the Initial Purchasers.
In addition, instead of issuing shares of Common Stock upon conversion, upon prior written notice to the holder, the Corporation may elect to pay the holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the closing sale price on the Principal Market on the day prior to the date of conversion (the "Conversion Date") multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable to the holder upon such conversion, or any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.
To the extent the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion would but for the limitation set forth in this Paragraph 5(b)(ii) exceed such limit, the Corporation shall redeem promptly (but not later than the fifth Trading Day after receipt of the applicable Conversion Notice) the shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock that may not be converted into shares of Common Stock as a result of such limitation for an amount in cash equal to the greater of (i) $1,500 per share of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) an amount equal to the product of the closing sale price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Date immediately preceding the date of the Conversion Notice and the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock could have been converted but for such limitation on the date of the Conversion Notice, and the holders of the Series H Convertible Preferred Stock shall be creditors of the Corporation with respect to that amount.
As compensation to the holder for such loss, the Corporation agrees to pay late payments to the holder for late issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion in accordance with the following schedule (where "No.

If on or after the third anniversary of the Original Issuance Date (such date as selected by the Corporation being the "Mandatory Conversion Date"), there remain issued and outstanding any shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, then the Corporation shall be entitled to require all (but not less than all) holders of shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding to convert their shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock or, at the option of the Corporation, to buy out all such holders in cash, at the price set forth in Paragraph 5(a).
The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall include (i) the Stated Value of the shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted or bought out, (ii) the Conversion Price at the Mandatory Conversion Date, and (iii) the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock to be issued (or the amount of cash to be paid in the event of a buy-out) upon such mandatory conversion or such mandatory buy-out at the then applicable Conversion Price.
