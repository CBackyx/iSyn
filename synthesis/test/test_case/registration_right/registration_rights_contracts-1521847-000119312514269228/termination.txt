If one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase the aggregate principal amount of Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the “Defaulted Securities”), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or any other purchaser, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:(i) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, each of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount of such Defaulted Securities in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Initial Purchasers; or(ii) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser.No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of its default.In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, the Representative shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the General Disclosure Package or Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements.
