Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.1, if the Company shall receive from Initiating Holders a written request signed by such Initiating Holders that the Company effect any registration of the Registrable Securities of the Company at an aggregate offering price to the public (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) of not less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (such request shall state the number of shares of Registrable Securities requested to be disposed of by such Initiating Holders), the Company will:
(i)            promptly give written notice of the proposed registration to all other Holders; and
(ii)           as soon as practicable, file and use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such registration (including, without limitation, filing post-effective amendments, appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws, and appropriate compliance with the Securities Act) and to permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such Registrable Securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities of any Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request received by the Company within twenty (20) days after such written notice from the Company is mailed or delivered; provided that unless a registration pursuant to this Section 2.1 is the Company’s Initial Public Offering, the Company also shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the registration statement within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the request from the Initiating Holders.
(iv)          During the period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date ninety (90) days (or in the case of the Company’s Initial Public Offering, one hundred eighty (180) days) after the effective date of, a Company-initiated registration (other than a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans); provided that (A) the Company is actively employing in good faith best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and, (B) with respect to any request for registration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) received prior the date of filing of such Company-initiated registration, the Company shall have delivered written notice to the holders of Registrable Securities of its intent to file such registration within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such request.
If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 2.1 and the Company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in subsection 2.1(a)(i).
The Company shall (together with all Holders proposing to distribute their securities
(i)            promptly give written notice of the proposed registration to all Holders; and
Such written request may specify all or a part of a Holder’s Registrable Securities.
In the case of each registration effected by the Company pursuant to this Section 2, the Company will keep each Holder advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and as to the completion thereof.
(e)                                  Notify each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or incomplete in light of the circumstances then existing, and following such notification promptly prepare and furnish to such Holder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such shares, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or incomplete in light of the circumstances then existing;
(j)                                    Use its reasonable best efforts to furnish, at the request of any Holder requesting registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a registration pursuant to this Section 2, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters and (ii) a letter dated such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters.
(c)                                  Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 2.6 (the “Indemnified Party”) shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the “Indemnifying Party”) promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such party’s expense; provided further, however, that an Indemnified Party (together with all other Indemnified Parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party, if representation of such Indemnified Party by the counsel retained by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding; and provided further, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 2.6, to the extent such failure is not prejudicial.
(ii)                                  Such Holder shall have given prior written notice to the Company of such Holder’s intention to make such disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed description of the manner and circumstances of the proposed disposition, and, if requested by the Company, such Holder shall have furnished the Company, at such Holder’s expense, with (A) an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such disposition will not require registration of such Restricted Securities under the Securities Act or (B) a “no action” letter from the Commission to the effect that the transfer of such securities without registration will not result in a recommendation by the staff of the Commission that action be taken with respect thereto, whereupon the holder of such Restricted Securities shall be entitled to transfer such Restricted Securities in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by the Holder to the Company.
(c)                                  So long as a Holder owns any Restricted Securities, furnish to the Holder forthwith upon written request a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 (at any time from and after ninety (90) days following the effective date of the first registration statement filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the general public), and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed as a Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing a Holder to sell any such securities without registration.
The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions and may stamp each such certificate with the second legend set forth in Section 2.8(b) hereof with respect to the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of such one hundred eighty (180) day period (or such other applicable period).
