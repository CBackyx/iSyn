The base prospectus contained in the Shelf Registration Statement, at the time such registration statement became effective, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement relating to the Offering, in the form in which it is to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, is hereinafter referred to as the “Prospectus,” except that if any revised prospectus or prospectus supplement shall be provided to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the Offering which differs from the Prospectus (whether or not such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations), the term “Prospectus” shall refer to such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to the Underwriters for such use.
Any preliminary prospectus supplement (and the related base prospectus) relating to the Offering filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations is hereafter referred to as the “Preliminary Prospectus.”  Any “issuer free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) relating to the Notes is hereafter referred to as an “Issuer Free Writing Prospectus;” and the Preliminary Prospectus, as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) and as supplemented by the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, attached and listed in Annex I hereto, taken together, are hereafter referred to collectively as the “Pricing Disclosure Package.”  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), on or before the effective date of the Registration Statement, the date of the Prospectus or the Applicable Time, as the case may be, and any reference herein to the terms “amend,” “amendment” or “supplement” with respect to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include (i) the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, that is incorporated therein by reference and (ii) any such document so filed.

Indemnification.
(a)                                 Each of the Company and the Guarantors shall, joint and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and its respective affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either (A) the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any “issuer information” (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Securities Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or (B) in any other materials or information provided to investors by, or with the written approval of, the Company in connection with the Offering, including any road show or investor presentations made to investors by the Company (whether in person or electronically), including any Issuer Written Communication (“Marketing Materials”), or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the (A) Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (B) in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any “issuer information,” or in any Marketing Materials, a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantors will be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 7(d).
This indemnity
agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
(b)                                 Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the (A) Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (B) in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 7(d).
This indemnity will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the
defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties) or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleading parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them, in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties; provided, however, if indemnity is sought pursuant to Section 7(e), then, in addition to the fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from its own counsel and that of the other indemnified parties for the QIU in its capacity as a “qualified independent underwriter” and all persons, if any, who control the QIU within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of Exchange Act in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances if, in the reasonable judgment of the QIU, there may exist a conflict of interest between the QIU and the other indemnified parties.
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, investigation, action or proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or reasonably could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, investigation, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or any failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(d)                                 The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that the statements with respect to the offering of the Notes by the Underwriters set forth in the “Discounts” and “Price stabilization and short positions” paragraphs of the section entitled “Underwriting” in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company or any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Marketing Materials.
(e)                                  In addition to and without limitation of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ obligations to indemnify Lebenthal & Co., LLC as an Underwriter, the Company and the Guarantors agree to indemnify and hold harmless the QIU, its affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the Securities Act) and selling agents and each person, if any, who controls the QIU within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, incurred as a result of the QIU’s participation as a “qualified independent underwriter” within the meaning of Rule 5121 in connection with the offering of the
Notes; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantors will be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the QIU.
8.
Contribution.
In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting, in the case of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses suffered by the Company and the Guarantors any contribution received by the Company and the Guarantors from persons, other than the Underwriters, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company and the Guarantors) as incurred to which the Company, the Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package.
The relative fault of each of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 8, each Underwriter and its respective affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.
Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 8 or otherwise.
The obligations of the Underwriters to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters, as the case may be, shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party.
9.
Default by an Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 9 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
10.
Survival of Representations and Agreements.
All representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Underwriters and the Company and the Guarantors contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any Subsidiary submitted pursuant hereto, including the agreements contained in Section 5, the indemnity agreements contained in Section 7 and the contribution agreements contained in Section 8, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its respective affiliates, directors, officers and employees, or any person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, any Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, or any other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes to and by the Underwriters.
11.
(a)                                 This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of this Agreement.
in the sole judgment of the Representative, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(d)           If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof (otherwise than pursuant to Section 9(b) or 11(b) hereof), or if the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth herein is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or any Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will, subject to demand by the Representative, reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel), incurred by the Underwriters in connection herewith.

(d)           Except as set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, nothing in this Section 13 shall affect the right of any person to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of any person to bring any action or proceeding against the Company or any Guarantor or their properties in the courts of other jurisdictions.
14.

This Agreement shall inure solely to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the Underwriters and the Company and the controlling persons, directors, officers, affiliates, employees and agents referred to in Section 7 and 8, and their respective successors and assigns, and no other person shall have or be construed to have any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of or by virtue of this Agreement or any provision herein contained.
