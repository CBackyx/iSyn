, 20
To the Representatives of the
    several Underwriters named in the
    Pricing Agreement
    hereinafter described.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The particular terms of any issuance of Securities will be determined at the time of offering.
Debt Securities, Debt Warrants, Currency Warrants and Stock-Index Warrants may be offered together or separately, and if offered together, the Debt Warrants, Currency Warrants and Stock-Index Warrants may detach from the Debt Securities after the time of offering.
The Company intends to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each, a “Pricing Agreement” and together the “Pricing Agreements”) in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the “Underwriters” with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) the particular Securities specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to each such Pricing Agreement, the “Designated Securities”).
Each Pricing Agreement shall constitute an agreement by the Company and the Underwriters to be bound by all of the provisions of this Underwriting Agreement.
1.
Representations and Warranties of the Company.
The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Underwriters with respect to each offering of Designated Securities that: (a) One or more registration statements on Form S-3 in respect of the Securities have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) and have become effective.
Each such registration statement (including the material incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits thereto but excluding the Form T-1), as amended at the time of any Pricing Agreement is hereinafter referred to, with respect to the transaction contemplated by such Pricing Agreement, as a “Registration Statement” and collectively such registration statements are referred to as the “Registration Statements”.
The prospectus then forming a part of the Registration Statements or deemed to meet the requirements thereof (including the material incorporated therein by reference), as then amended, and as supplemented to reflect the terms of the Designated Securities and the terms of offering thereof, and any other material reflected in such supplement, in the form in which it is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing, is hereinafter referred to as the “Prospectus” and such supplement is hereinafter referred to as the “Supplement”.
(b) On its effective date and on the effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment thereto, each registration statement relating to the Securities (including the material incorporated therein by reference) conformed in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”), and the rules and regulations of the Commission (the “Rules and Regulations”), and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, on the date of each Pricing Agreement and each time each Registration Statement is amended, each Registration Statement as then amended, and, each time the Prospectus is amended, on the date of each supplement thereto and on the date of the Supplement, the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented, will conform in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations and will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any such documents based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
(c) As of the “Time of Sale” in the applicable Pricing Agreement, the disclosure package comprised of (i) the Prospectus, as then amended and supplemented, (ii) the issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 (each, an “Issuer Free Writing Prospectus”), if any, identified in Schedule IV to such Pricing Agreement, and (iii) the final term sheet with respect to the Designated Securities prepared and filed pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3(b) hereto (the “Final Term Sheet”) or, if no such Final Term Sheet is reasonably requested by the Underwriters pursuant to Section 3(b) hereto, the terms of the Designated Securities and the offering as set forth on Schedules I, II and III to the Pricing Agreement (together, the “Disclosure Package”), when taken together as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The foregoing sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule V to the applicable Pricing Agreement.
(d) Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and, if applicable, the Final Term Sheet, do not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated therein and any Supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified.
2
(e) The Company has not been and is not an “ineligible issuer” as defined in Rule 405 under the Act at the times specified in the Act in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities.
2.
(a) Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities for whom the firm or firms designated as representative or representatives of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representative or representatives (as the case may be), which may include all such Underwriters in the absence of a syndicate (the “Representatives”).
This Underwriting Agreement, alone, shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities.
Such obligation shall come into existence only upon execution, by the Company and the Representatives named therein, of the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein.
Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the firms which will be Underwriters and their Representatives, the principal amount and/or the number of the Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter, the purchase price to be paid by the Underwriters, the initial public offering price, the terms of the Designated Securities not already specified in the Indenture, including, but not limited to, as applicable, currency in which denominated and/or payable, interest rate, maturity, redemption provisions and sinking fund requirements (if any), or not already specified in the Warrant Agreement and whether any of the Designated Securities may be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts (“Delayed Delivery Contracts”).
The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
(b) Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of such Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer such Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Supplement relating to such Designated Securities.
3.
Covenants of the Company.
In connection with each offering of Designated Securities, the Company covenants and agrees with the Underwriters: (a) To make no further amendment or any supplement to any Registration Statement or Prospectus after the Time of Sale set forth in the applicable Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and prior to the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities which shall be reasonably disapproved by the Representatives for such Designated Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of 3
(c) If there occurs an event or development as a result of which (i) the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to comply with law, then the Company will notify promptly the Underwriters so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented.
(d) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Designated Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.
(f) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the date of each Pricing Agreement, an earnings statement of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the Rules and Regulations (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 of the Act).
(h) To pay all expenses incident to the performance of the Company’s obligations under this Agreement, and to reimburse the Underwriters for any expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with qualifications of the Designated Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto and for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for rating of the Designated Securities.
3A.
Free Writing Prospectuses.
The Company agrees with the Underwriters that, in connection with each offering of Designated Securities, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company and the Representatives that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a “free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than the information contained in the Final Term Sheet; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule IV to the respective Pricing Agreement.
Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company, as the case may be, is hereinafter referred to as a “Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.” The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of 5
Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
4.
Conditions.
The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities hereunder shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: (a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statements shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering of such Designated Securities shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission.
(b) Counsel for the Underwriters, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, shall have furnished to the Representatives an opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery of such Designated Securities, as to the incorporation of the Company, the Designated Securities, the Indenture and any Warrant Agreement, the Registration Statements, Disclosure Package and Prospectus (and any amendments or supplements thereto) and such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to them.
(c) Counsel for the Company, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, shall have furnished to the Representatives an opinion, dated the Time of Delivery of such Designated Securities, as to the incorporation of the Company, the Designated Securities, the Indenture and any Warrant Agreement, the Registration Statements, Disclosure Package and Prospectus (and any amendments or supplements thereto) and such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to them.
(e) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package there shall not have been any change in the financial position, shareowners’ equity, results of operations, business, operations or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Disclosure Package, the effect of which is, when viewed in relation to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package.
(f) Subsequent to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded to the Company’s senior debt securities by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (g) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) trading in the Company’s Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any 6
outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis if the effect of any such event described in this clause (iii) on the financial markets of the United States, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(i) If the Designated Securities include Currency Warrants or Stock-Index Warrants, such warrants shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on a “national securities exchange” as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
5.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus supplement (or contained in any Registration Statement after it first becomes effective but prior to the Pricing Agreement or in any prospectus forming a part thereof during such period), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter, directly or through the Representatives, expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter, directly or through the Representatives, expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
The omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party, provided that, in the case of any such omission relating to the commencement of an action, such omission shall relieve the 7
indemnifying party of liability under such subsection.
In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties, or both, which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.
Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party or its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation conducted at the request of such indemnifying party) unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel, approved by such indemnifying party, representing the indemnified parties under such subsection who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 shall be unavailable to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities and also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bears to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus.
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, including the consequences of such failure, and whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters, directly or through the Representatives, on the other hand.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by per-capita allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this 8
subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act, and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signs the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
6.
Default of Underwriters.
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein.
The term “Underwriter” as used in the Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
As used in this subsection (b) and in subsection (c) below of this Section 6, the “aggregate principal amount” of Designated Securities shall mean the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities that are Debt Securities 9
plus the public offering price, if any, of any Debt Warrants, Currency Warrants or Stock-Index Warrants included in the Designated Securities.
7.
Survival of Indemnities, Representations, Etc.
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
8.
Reimbursement of Underwriters’ Expenses.
If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 6 hereof or if the Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company because of any of the events referred to in Section 4(g), then the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 3(h) and Section 5 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 3(h) and Section 5 hereof.
9.
In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice, waiver or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives.
10.
Binding Effect; Successors.
This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement.
No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
10
11.
No Fiduciary Duty.
The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm’s-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other hand, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company’s engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity.
Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement or any related Pricing Agreement).
The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
12.
Applicable Law.
This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
13.
Counterparts.
This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

[The Company authorizes the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Designated Securities from the Company pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts substantially in the form of Schedule III hereto but with such changes therein as the Company may approve.
Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with purchasers of the types approved by the Company and set forth in the Prospectus and subject to other conditions set forth in such Delayed Delivery Contracts.
Except as the Company may otherwise agree, each Delayed Delivery Contract must be for the minimum principal amount set forth in Schedule II hereto and the aggregate principal amount of all Delayed Delivery Contracts may not exceed the amount set forth in such Schedule II.
The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of any Delayed Delivery Contracts.]
