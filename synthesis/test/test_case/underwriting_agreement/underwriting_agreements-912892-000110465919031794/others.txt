To the Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities on the terms and in the manner set forth herein.
The Securities are to be offered and
1
sold through the Underwriters pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form F-3 ASR (No.
333-231344), including a prospectus, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), which became effective upon filing with the Commission on May 9, 2019.
Such registration statement, at any given time, together with the amendments thereto to such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 6 of Form F-3 under the Securities Act (as defined below) at such time, the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by the Securities Act at such time and the information that is deemed to be a part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B promulgated under the Securities Act, are herein called, collectively, the “Registration Statement.”
The Company has prepared a preliminary prospectus, including the base prospectus and a preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, which was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (“Securities Act”).
Each prospectus and prospectus supplement, including the base prospectus, used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a “preliminary prospectus.”  The base prospectus in the form most recently filed with the Commission as part of the Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented (including any preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) relating to the Securities immediately prior to the Applicable Time, are herein called, collectively, the “Pricing Prospectus.”  The final prospectus, including the base prospectus and a final prospectus supplement, in the form first furnished (electronically or otherwise) to the Underwriters to confirm sales of the Securities (whether to meet the requests of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 promulgated under the Securities Act or otherwise) or, if not furnished to the Underwriters, in the form first filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b), together with the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 6 of Form F-3 under the Securities Act at the time of execution of this Agreement, is herein called the “Prospectus.”
For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (“EDGAR”).
“General Disclosure Package” means the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet (as hereinafter defined) and any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) existing at the Applicable Time (as hereinafter defined) and the information therein which is intended for general distribution to prospective investors, as evidenced by its being specified in Schedule D to this Agreement.
“Final Term Sheet” means a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, included in Schedule E to this Agreement.
“Free Writing Prospectus” means any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) relating to the Securities.
2
“Issuer Free Writing Prospectus” means any issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) relating to the Securities in the form filed or required to be filed with the Commission or, if not required to be filed, in the form retained in the Company’s records pursuant to Rule 433(g) under the Securities Act, including without limitation, any “road show that is a written communication” within the meaning of Rule 433(d)(8)(i).
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is “contained,” “included” or “stated” in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information that are set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any such preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the “Exchange Act”), which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any such preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
SECTION 1.
Representations and Warranties by the Company.
(a)                                 Representations and Warranties.
The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Time referred to in Section 2(b) hereof, and agrees with each Underwriter, as follows:
(i)                                     Registration Statement.
The Registration Statement is an “automatic shelf registration statement” (as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that has been filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date of this Underwriting Agreement; no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company; and no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued by the Commission and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or related to the offering of the Securities has been initiated or is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, is contemplated or threatened by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information pertaining to the Registration Statement has been complied with.
As of its applicable effective date, the Registration Statement conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”), and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
At the
3
Applicable Time, the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act, and neither the (i) Registration Statement (as amended or supplemented by the Pricing Prospectus) nor (ii) the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The Prospectus, as of its date complied, and as of the Closing Time will comply, in all material respects with the Securities Act, and, as of its date did not, and as of the Closing Time will not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
This representation, warranty and agreement shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriters expressly for use therein.
(ii)                                  Incorporated Documents.
The documents or sections thereof incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus to the extent so incorporated by reference, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and, when read together with the other information in the General Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time and at the Closing Time, did not and will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(iii)                               General Disclosure Package.
At the Applicable Time, neither the General Disclosure Package nor any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
This representation, warranty and agreement shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the General Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriters expressly for use therein.
(iv)                              Eligibility under Certain Commission Rules.
The Company meets the requirements for use of Form F-3 under the Securities Act.
The Company was, and is, a “well-known seasoned issuer” and was not, and is not, an “ineligible issuer” (in each case as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) at any “determination date” under Rule 164 under the Securities Act or Rule 405 under the Securities Act that is relevant to the offering of the Securities.
4
(v)                                 Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the sale of the Securities or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Underwriters as disclosed in Section 5(a) hereof, did not, does not and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information then contained in the Registration Statement.
This representation, warranty and agreement shall not apply to statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriters expressly for use therein.

The Securities and the Indenture will conform in all material respects to the respective statements relating thereto contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and will be in substantially the respective forms last delivered to the Underwriters prior to the date of this Agreement.
Upon due execution by the Company and authentication and delivery by the Trustee of certificates evidencing Securities pursuant to the Indenture, persons in whose names the certificates are registered will be entitled to the rights specified in the Indenture.
(xvii)                    Absence of Defaults and Conflicts.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of its estatutos sociales or in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject (collectively, “Agreements and Instruments”) except for such violations or defaults that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect; and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, the Securities and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption “Use of Proceeds” as such terms are used in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus) and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or a Repayment Event (as defined below) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, the Agreements and Instruments except for such conflicts, breaches, defaults or Repayment Events, or the creation or imposition of liens, charges or encumbrances that, singly or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the estatutos sociales of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations (except for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults or the creation or imposition of such liens, charges or encumbrances that, singly or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect).
As used herein, a “Repayment Event” means any event or condition which gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or any person acting on such holder’s behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
8
(xviii)                 Absence of Labor Dispute.
No labor dispute with the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent, and the Company is not aware of any existing or imminent labor disturbance by the employees of any of its or any of its subsidiaries’ principal suppliers, manufacturers, customers or contractors, which, in either case, may reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as disclosed in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation (with respect only to investigations as to antitrust matters by the Comisión Federal de Competencia (COFECE) or the Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT), to the extent that a dictamen de probable responsabilidad (statement of objections) against the Company or its subsidiaries has been issued) before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (considered as one enterprise) or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Indenture, the Securities, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder.
The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective property or assets is the subject which are not described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(xx)                          Possession of Intellectual Property.
The Company and its subsidiaries own or possess, or can acquire on reasonable terms, adequate patents, patent rights, licenses, inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), trademarks, service marks, trade names or other intellectual property (collectively, “Intellectual Property”) necessary to carry on the business now operated by them, except where the inability to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice or is otherwise aware of any infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or circumstances which would render any Intellectual Properly invalid or inadequate to protect the interest of the Company or any of its subsidiaries therein, and which infringement or conflict (if the subject of any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding) or invalidity or inadequacy, singly or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.
No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency is necessary or required
9
for the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or under the Indenture or the Securities, in connection with the offering, issuance or sale of the Securities and hereunder and thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture, or for the due execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Indenture, by the Company, except (i) as may be required under the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act and foreign or state securities or blue sky laws, (ii) the notice to the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission (Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, the “CNBV”) of the offering of the Securities according to Article 7 of the Ley del Mercado de Valores (the “Mexican Securities Market Law”), and (iii) as may be required to list the Securities on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
(xxii)                    Possession of Licenses and Permits.
The Company and its subsidiaries possess such permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively, “Governmental Licenses”) issued by the appropriate federal, state, local regulatory agencies or bodies in Mexico and in each other applicable jurisdiction necessary to conduct the business now operated by them, except where the failure to have such Governmental Licenses would not have a Material Adverse Effect; the Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, except where the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(xxiii)                 Title to Property.
The Company and its subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all real property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and good title to all other properties owned by them, in each case, free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind except such as (a) are described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, (b) in cases where the absence of such title, singly or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or (c) such mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances which, singly or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and all of the leases and subleases material to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, and under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries holds properties described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, are in full force and effect except those the absence of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any notice of any material claim of any
10

(xxxvi)         Enforceability of New York Judgment.
Any final judgment for a fixed or readily calculable sum of money rendered by any state court in the State of New York or United States federal court located in the State of New York having jurisdiction under its own domestic laws in respect of any suit, action or proceeding against the Company based upon this Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities would be declared enforceable against the Company by the courts of Mexico without reexamination, review of the merits of the cause of action in respect of which the original judgment was given or relitigation of the matters adjudicated upon or payment of any stamp, registration or similar tax on duty, provided that (a) such judgment is obtained in compliance with legal requirements of the jurisdiction of the court rendering such judgment and in compliance with the terms set forth in the relevant agreement; (b) such judgment is strictly for the payment of a certain sum of money and has been rendered in an in personam action as opposed to an in rem action; (c) process was served personally on the Company or on the appropriate process agent (a Mexican court would consider personal service of process upon the agent for service of process appointed in Section 12 of this Agreement to be personal service of process meeting procedural requirements of Mexico); provided that service of process by mail is not deemed to be personal service under the laws of Mexico; (d) such judgment does not contravene Mexican law, Mexican public policy, international treaties or agreements binding upon Mexico or generally accepted principles of international law; (e) the applicable procedure under the laws of Mexico with respect to the enforcement of foreign judgments (including, but not limited to, the issuance of a letter rogatory by the competent authority of such jurisdiction requesting enforcement of such judgment as authentic by the corresponding authorities of such jurisdiction in accordance with the laws thereof) is complied with; (f) such judgment is final in the jurisdiction in which it was issued; (g) the action in respect of which such judgment was rendered is not the subject matter of a lawsuit among the same parties pending before a Mexican court; (h) any such foreign court would enforce final judgments rendered by the federal or state courts of Mexico as a matter of reciprocity; and (i) the judgment and related documents are translated into Spanish by a duly authorized expert for their admissibility before the Mexican courts before which enforcement is requested, such translation being subject to approval by the Mexican court after the defendant has been given an opportunity to be heard with respect to the accuracy of the translation, and such proceedings would thereafter be based upon the translated documents.

It is not necessary under the laws of Mexico or any political subdivision thereof or authority or agency therein in order to enable an owner of any interest in the Securities to enforce its rights under the Securities or to enable any Underwriter to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities, as the case may be, that it should, as a result solely of its holding of the Securities, be licensed, qualified or otherwise entitled to carry on business in Mexico or any political subdivision thereof or
14
authority or agency therein; this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities are in proper legal form under the laws of Mexico and any political subdivision thereof or authority or agency therein for the enforcement thereof against the Company therein; and it is not necessary to ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities in Mexico or any political subdivision thereof or authority or agency therein that any of them be filed or recorded or enrolled with any court, authority or agency in, or that any stamp, registration or similar taxes or duties be paid to any court, authority or agency of, Mexico or any political subdivision thereof, except that in the event that any proceedings are brought before a Mexican court to enforce this Agreement, a Spanish translation of the documents required in such proceedings will need to be provided, which translation would need to be certified by a Mexican court-approved translator.

SECTION 7.
Indemnification.
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers and affiliates and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act as follows:
(i)                                     against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in each case as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the case of any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii)                                  against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 7(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
(iii)                               against any and all expense whatsoever, as reasonably incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Underwriters), in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
25
Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and affiliates and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 7, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in each case as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
(c)                                  Actions against Parties; Notification.
Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.
In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Underwriters, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.
An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party.
In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
Notwithstanding the indemnifying party’s election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ one separate counsel (in addition to any required local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs, and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 or Section 8 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation,
26
proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement unless the indemnifying party in good faith shall be contesting the reasonableness of such fees and expenses (but only to the extent so contested) or the entitlement of the indemnified party to indemnification under the terms of this Section 7.
SECTION 8.
Contribution.
If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8.
The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an
27
indemnified party shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, in no event will any Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased and sold by such Underwriter hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, agent, employee and affiliate of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, agent, employee and affiliate of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
The Underwriters’ respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
SECTION 9.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its respective subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.
SECTION 10.
Termination of Agreement.
(a)                                 Termination; General.

de C.V. (the “Mexican Stock Exchange”), the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Market or the Mexican Stock Exchange has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either United States Federal, New York or Mexican authorities.
(b)                                 Liabilities.
SECTION 11.
Default by One or More of the Underwriters.
(a)                                 if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of Securities to be purchased hereunder, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
As used herein, the term “Underwriter” includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 11.
29
SECTION 12.

(b)                                 Appointment of Service Agent.
The Company designates, appoints, and empowers CT Corporation System, with offices currently at 28 Liberty Street, New York, New York 10005, as its designee, appointee and agent to receive and accept for and on its behalf, and its properties, assets and revenues, service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents that may be served in any action, suit or proceeding brought against any of the Company in any such United States federal or state court with respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and the Indenture and that may be made on such designee, appointee and agent in accordance with legal procedures prescribed for such courts.
If for any reason such designee, appointee and agent hereunder shall cease to be available to act as such, the Company agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in The City of New York on the terms and for the purposes of this Section 12 reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters.
The Company further hereby irrevocably consents and agrees to the service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents in any such action, suit or proceeding against the Company by serving a copy thereof upon the relevant agent for service of process referred to in this Section 12 (whether or not the appointment of such agent shall for any reason prove to be ineffective or such agent shall accept or acknowledge such service).
The Company agrees that the failure of any such designee, appointee and agent to give any notice of such service to them shall not impair or affect in any way the validity of such service or any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon.
Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability of the Underwriters and the other persons referred to in Sections 7 and 8 to serve any such legal process, summons, notices and documents in any other manner permitted by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the Company or bring actions, suits or proceedings against them in such other jurisdictions, and in such manner, as may be permitted by applicable law.
Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and the Indenture brought in the federal courts located in The City of New York or the courts of the State of New York located in The County of New York and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not to plead or claim in any federal court located in The City of New York or any court of the State of New York located in The County of New York that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
(c)                                  Survival.
The provisions of this Section 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part.
SECTION 13.
Foreign Taxes.
All payments by the Company to any Underwriter hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any and all present and future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
30
charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereinafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by Mexico or any other jurisdiction in which the Company has a branch or an office from which payment is made or deemed to be made, excluding (i) any such tax imposed by reason of any Underwriter having some connection with any such jurisdiction other than its participation as Underwriter hereunder, and (ii) any income or franchise tax on the overall net income of such Underwriter imposed by the United States of America or by the State of New York or any political subdivision of the United States of America or of the State of New York (all such non-excluded taxes, “Foreign Taxes”).
If the Company is prevented by operation of law or otherwise from paying, causing to be paid or remitting that portion of amounts payable hereunder represented by Foreign Taxes withheld or deducted, then amounts payable under this Agreement by such party shall, to the extent permitted by law, be increased to such amount as is necessary to yield and remit to each Underwriter an amount which, after deduction of all Foreign Taxes (including all Foreign Taxes payable on such increased payments) equals the amount that would have been payable if no Foreign Taxes applied.
SECTION 14.
To the extent that the Company or any of its respective properties, assets or revenues may have or may hereafter become entitled to, or have attributed to it, any right of immunity, on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise, from any legal action, suit or proceeding, from the giving of any relief in any thereof, from set-off or counterclaim, from the jurisdiction of any court, from service or process, from attachment upon or prior to judgment, from attachment in aid of execution of judgment, or from execution of judgment, or other legal process or proceeding for the giving of any relief or for the enforcement of any judgment, in any jurisdiction in which proceedings may at any time be commenced, with respect to their obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out of or based on this Agreement, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not to plead or claim, any such immunity and consents to such relief and enforcement.
SECTION 15.
Judgment Currency.
The Company agrees to indemnify the Underwriters against any loss incurred by such Underwriters as a result of any judgment or order being given or made for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than United States dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which the Underwriters are able to purchase United States dollars, at the business day nearest the date of judgment, with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by the Underwriters.
The foregoing indemnity shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.
Each of the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify the Company against any loss incurred by the Company as a result of any judgment or order being given or made for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a Judgment Currency other than United States dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which the Company is able to purchase United States dollars, at the business day nearest the date of judgment, with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by the Company.
The
31
foregoing indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent, several and not joint, obligation of the Underwriters and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.
For purposes of this Section 15, the term “rate of exchange” shall include any premiums and costs or exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.
