The Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing.
The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

(l)                                     The Company agrees to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters:  (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may, in each case, be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance

Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a “Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.”  The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

21
the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(i)                                     the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii)                                  no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company’s knowledge, threatened; and
(iii)                               since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(g)                                  Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or
22
contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
(i)                                     The Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities shall have been listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and satisfactory evidence of such actions shall have been provided to the Representatives.

8.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, and agents of each Underwriter, each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or any Written Testing-the-Waters Communication or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b)                                 Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading “Underwriting” or “Plan of Distribution”, (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (iv) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (v) the sentences related to the underwriters’ intent to make a market in the Securities, in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing
24
by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c)                                  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.
The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party’s choice at the indemnifying party’s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
Notwithstanding the indemnifying party’s election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (which, if the Company is the indemnifying party, shall be limited to one such separate counsel for any Underwriter together with all persons who control such Underwriter within the meaning of the Exchange Act or the Act, and no more than three such separate counsel for all the Underwriters) if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.
An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
25
(d)                                 In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively “Losses”) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.
If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.
Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Default by an Underwriter.

Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.
In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

Supplementing the Preliminary Prospectus
Supplement dated September 22, 2014
The information in this pricing term sheet supplements TESARO, Inc.’s preliminary prospectus supplement, dated September 22, 2014 (the “Preliminary Prospectus Supplement”) and the accompanying prospectus dated July 1, 2013, and supersedes the information in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying prospectus to the extent inconsistent therewith.
Terms used, but not defined, in this pricing term sheet have the respective meanings set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this pricing term sheet to the “Issuer” refer only to TESARO, Inc. and not to its subsidiaries.
Issuer:
Ticker / Exchange for Common Stock:
Trade Date:
September 24, 2014.
Notes:

Record Dates:
$26.025 per share of the Issuer’s common stock (the “Common Stock”).

Use of Proceeds:
The Issuer expects to use the remaining net proceeds that it will receive from this offering to fund commercialization activities for rolapitant (oral formulation), clinical trials for rolapitant (intravenous formulation), niraparib and its other product candidates, to carry out its immuno-oncology platform strategy, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.
The Issuer may also use a portion of the proceeds to in-license or acquire, as the case may be, product candidates, technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses, though the Issuer has no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.

Capped Call Transactions:
In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Issuer expects to enter into capped call transactions (the “capped call transactions”) with one or more of the underwriters (or their affiliates) (in such capacities, the “hedge counterparties”).
The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes.
The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments the Issuer is required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the floor price of the capped call transactions, which initially corresponds to the Initial Conversion Price of the Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Notes.
If, however, the market price per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, the number of shares of the Common Stock and/or amounts of cash the Issuer receives upon exercise of the capped call transactions will be capped.
CUSIP Number:
ISIN Number:
US881569AA53
Capitalization:
The “As Adjusted” column in the capitalization table on page S-28 of the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement does not give effect to the Issuer’s entry into the capped call transactions, the payment of the premiums therefor to the hedge counterparties or such reductions to the Issuer’s additional paid-in capital, stockholders’ equity and total capitalization.

The exact stock prices and effective dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
·                  If the stock price is between two stock prices in the table or the effective date is between two effective dates in the table, the number of additional shares by which the conversion rate will be increased will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of additional shares set forth for the next higher and next lower stock prices and the earlier and later effective dates based on a 365-day year, as applicable.
The Issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus), and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for the offering to which this communication relates.
Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and other documents the Issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Issuer and this offering.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
In order to induce you and the other Underwriters to enter into the Underwriting Agreement, the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the undersigned or any affiliate of the undersigned or any person in privity with the undersigned or any affiliate of the undersigned), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement (other than on Form S-8) with the Securities and Exchange Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder with respect to (together, the “Exchange Act”), any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, for a period from the date hereof until 60 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement (the “Lock-Up Period”), other than shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock disposed of not for consideration as bona fide gifts, by estate planning or intestacy, or distributions to limited partners, members, stockholders or affiliates of the undersigned; provided that (a) each recipient of transferred shares agrees in writing to be bound by the same restrictions in place for the undersigned pursuant to this letter for the duration of the Lock-Up Period and (b) and no filing under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act reporting a reduction in beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock shall be required or shall be voluntarily made by the undersigned during the Lock-Up Period.
The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired in the Offering or in open market transactions; provided that no filing under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act reporting a reduction in beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock shall be required or shall be voluntarily made by the undersigned during the Lock-Up Period.

Underwriters unless such Stockholder shall have first made a request pursuant to the clause (i) of the preceding paragraph.

Second Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement dated as of June 6, 2011 (as amended, the “IRA”), if the undersigned is a party to the IRA and is a Holder of Registrable Securities (as such terms are defined therein), the undersigned, together with the other Holders entering into lock-up agreements in connection with the Offering, hereby waives on behalf of all Holders any registration or notice rights under the IRA, including without limitation any rights pursuant to Section 2.2 of the IRA.
