Interest Determination Dates:Reset Date Designated LIBOR Page: Method of Calculation: Subordination Provisions:Floating Interest Rate Provisions:The Floating Rate Global Notes will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent.
The interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 1.55%.
Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date.
Interest payments on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be made quarterly in arrears on March 19, June 19, September 19 and December 19 of each year, commencing December 19, 2011 to the person in whose name the Floating Rate Global Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date.
Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will accrue from and including September 19, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be.
Each of these periods is referred to as an “interest period.” The amount of accrued interest that HP will pay for any interest period shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of the Floating Rate Global Notes then outstanding by an accrued interest factor.
This accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from September 19, 2011, or from the latest date interest was paid to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated.
The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that date by 360.
If an Interest Payment Date for the Floating Rate Global Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the following month, in which case, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.On any interest determination date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on “Reuters Page LIBOR01” at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date.
Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.
Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period.Upon request from any holder of Floating Rate Global Notes, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect for the Floating Rate Global Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
