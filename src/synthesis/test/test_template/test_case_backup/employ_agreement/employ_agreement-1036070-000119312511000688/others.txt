WHEREAS, the Executive has been and continues to be a key executive of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company considers the availability of the Executive’s services to be important to the management and conduct of the Company’s business and desires to secure the continued availability of the Executive’s services;
WHEREAS, the Executive is willing to make his services available to the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.
In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
Part I: General Employment Terms
Employment and Duties.
Conditional upon the Executive’s being in the employment of the Company on January 1, 2011 (the “Effective Date”), and effective at the Effective Date, the Executive shall be employed in such senior executive capacity or capacities (individually and collectively, the “Position”) with the Company and/or any one or more of its subsidiaries as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company (individually and collectively, the “Employer”) on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.
The Executive accepts such employment and agrees to perform the managerial duties and responsibilities of the Position.
The Executive agrees to devote the necessary time and attention on a full-time basis to the discharge of such duties and responsibilities of an executive nature relating to the Position as may be assigned to the Executive by the Board of Directors of the Company or its designee.
The Executive may accept any elective or appointed positions or offices with any duly recognized associations or organizations whose activities or purposes are closely related to the banking business or service which would generate goodwill for the Company and its subsidiaries, provided that the Executive must notify the Board of Directors of the Company periodically of such positions or offices which he holds.
The term of this Agreement, including any renewal term, is referred to as the “Term.”
(b) Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives.
During the Term, the Executive may participate in such short-term and/or long-term cash and/or equity incentive plan(s) in such manner and subject to such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as the case may be, in its sole discretion may determine.4.
The Executive shall be eligible to participate in any plans, programs or forms of compensation or benefits that the Company or its subsidiaries provide to the class of employees that includes the Executive, on a basis not less favorable than that provided to such class of employees, including, without limitation, group medical, disability and life insurance, vacation and sick leave, and a retirement plan; provided, however, a reasonable transition period following any change in control, merger, statutory share exchange, consolidation, acquisition or transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be permitted in order to make appropriate adjustments in compliance with this Section 4(a).
“Incapacity” shall mean the failure of the Executive to perform the Executive’s assigned duties with the Company on a full-time basis as a result of mental or physical illness or injury as determined by a physician selected by the Company for ninety (90) consecutive calendar days.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such payments and benefits under Section 7(a) otherwise continuing for periods after the Executive’s termination of employment shall cease to be paid, and the Company and the Employer shall have no further obligation due with respect thereto, in the event the Executive engages in “Competition” or makes any “Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information.” In addition, in exchange for the payments on termination as provided herein, other provisions of this Agreement and other valuable consideration hereby acknowledged and except as limited by Section 7(a) or 7(d), the Executive agrees that the Executive will not engage in Competition for a period of eighteen (18) 5
For purposes hereof:(i) “Competition” means the Executive’s engaging without the written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company or a person authorized thereby, in an activity as an officer, a director, an employee, a partner, a more than one percent shareholder or other owner, an agent, a consultant, or in any other individual or representative capacity within ten (10) miles of headquarters or any branch office of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (unless the Executive’s duties, responsibilities and activities, including supervisory activities, for or on behalf of such activity, are not related in any way to such competitive activity) if it involves:(A) engaging in or entering into the business of any banking, lending or any other business activity in which the Company or any subsidiary thereof is actively engaged at the time the Executive’s employment ceases, or(B) soliciting or contacting, either directly or indirectly, any of the customers or clients of the Company or any subsidiary thereof for the purpose of competing with the products or services provided by the Company or any subsidiary thereof, or(C) employing or soliciting for employment any employees of the Company or any subsidiary thereof for the purpose of competing with the Company or any subsidiary thereof;provided, however, that activity which cannot reasonably be construed to have the potential to compete with or to further competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall not be prohibited by this Agreement.
(ii) “Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information” means the use or disclosure of information in violation of Section 8 of this Agreement.
(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, “customers” or “clients” of the Company or any subsidiary thereof means individuals or entities to whom the Company or any subsidiary thereof has provided banking, lending, or other similar financial services at any time from the Effective Date through the date the Executive’s employment with the Company ceases.
The Executive will still be required to comply with the non-solicitation, non-contact, non-hire and confidentiality covenants set forth in Section 7(b).
The Executive acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section 7(b) of this Agreement are just, reasonable, and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company.
The Executive further acknowledges that if the Executive breaches or threatens to breach any provision of Section 7(b), the Company’s remedies at law will be inadequate, and the Company will be irreparably harmed.
Accordingly, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, both preliminary and permanent, restraining the Executive from such breach or threatened breach, such injunctive relief not to preclude the Company from pursuing all available legal and equitable remedies.
In addition to all other available remedies, if the Executive violates the provisions of Section 7(b), the Executive shall pay all costs and fees, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing the provisions of that Section.
If, on the other hand, it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that a breach or threatened breach did not occur under Section 7(b) of this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable legal fees incurred to defend that claim.8.
Confidentiality.
As an employee of the Company, the Executive will have access to and may participate in the origination of non-public, proprietary and confidential information relating to the Company and/or its subsidiaries, and the Executive acknowledges a fiduciary duty owed to the Company and its subsidiaries not to disclose impermissibly any such information.
Confidential information may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, customer lists and information, internal corporate planning, methods of marketing and operation, and other data or information of or concerning the Company or its customers that is not generally known to the public or in the banking industry.
The Executive agrees never to use or disclose to any third party any such confidential information, either directly or indirectly, except as may be authorized in writing specifically by the Company.Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to prohibit the Executive from performing any duty or obligation that shall arise as a matter of law.
Specifically, the Executive shall continue to be under a duty to truthfully respond to any legal and valid subpoena or other legal process.
This Agreement is not intended in any way to proscribe the Executive’s right and ability to provide information to any federal, state or local agency in response or adherence to the lawful exercise of such agency’s authority.
In the event the Executive is requested to disclose confidential information by subpoena or other legal process or lawful exercise of authority, the Executive shall promptly provide the Company with notice of the same and either receive approval from the Company to make the disclosure or cooperate with the Company in the Company’s effort, at its sole expense, to avoid disclosure.Part II: Change of Control9.
If a Change of Control of the Company occurs during the Term, and the Executive is employed by the Company on the date the Change 7
of Control occurs (the “Change of Control Date”), the Company will continue to employ the Executive in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the period beginning on the Change of Control Date and ending on the third anniversary of such date (the “Change of Control Employment Period”).
If a Change of Control occurs on account of a series of transactions, the Change of Control Date is the date of the last of such transactions.
Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Agreement, in the event of a Change of Control of the Company, Sections 9 through 15 in this Part II shall become effective and govern the terms and conditions of the Executive’s employment during the Change of Control Employment Period and supersede any inconsistent provisions of Part I.
For purposes hereof, the term “affiliated companies” includes any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company.10.
During the Change of Control Employment Period, (i) the Executive’s position, authority, duties and responsibilities will be at least commensurate in all material respects with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned at any time during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the Change of Control Date, and (ii) the Executive’s services will be performed at the location where the Executive was employed immediately preceding the Change of Control Date or any office that is the headquarters of the Company or the Employer and is less than thirty-five (35) miles from such location; it being understood and agreed that this subsection (ii) shall supercede the provisions of Section 6(c)(iii) dealing with the relocation of the Executive following a Change of Control.
Following any Change of Control, to the extent that any amount of pay or benefits provided to the Executive under this Agreement would cause the Executive to be subject to an excise tax under sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and after taking into consideration all other amounts payable to the Executive under other Company plans, programs, policies, and arrangements, then the amount of pay and benefits provided under this Agreement shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of any such excise taxes.
(b) The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment the Company becomes obligated to make to the Executive in connection with this Agreement, by seeking other employment or otherwise.
Except as specifically provided above with respect to the Health Care Continuance Benefit, the amount of any payment provided for in Section 12 shall not be reduced, offset or subject to recovery by the Company by reason of any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination, or otherwise.
Otherwise, the noncompetition covenant in Section 7(b) shall apply.
Continuance of Health Care Continuation Benefits Upon Death.
If the Executive dies while receiving a Health Care Continuance Benefit, the Executive’s spouse and dependents will continue to be covered under all applicable Health Care Plans during the remainder of the thirty-six (36) month coverage period as described above.
The Executive’s spouse and dependents will become eligible for COBRA continuation coverage for health and dental benefits at the end of such thirty-six (36) month period.15.

If any provision of this Agreement, or part thereof, is determined to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, it shall be severable from the remainder of this Agreement and shall not invalidate or affect the other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and shall be enforceable according to their terms.
No covenant shall be dependent upon any other covenant or provision herein, each of which stands independently.18.

The Company will require any successor to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
No Construction Against Any Party.
This Agreement is the product of informed negotiations between the Executive and the Company.
If any part of this Agreement is deemed to be unclear or ambiguous, it shall be construed as if it were drafted jointly by all parties.
The Executive and the Company agree that neither party was in a superior bargaining position regarding the substantive terms of this Agreement.24.
Code 409A Omnibus Provision.
The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance issued thereunder or comply with an exemption from the application of Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, all provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company’s Compensation Committee or Board of Directors is authorized to amend this Agreement, to amend or void any election made by the Executive under this Agreement and/or to delay the payment of any monies and/or provision of any benefits in such manner as may be determined by it to be necessary or appropriate to comply, or to evidence or further evidence required compliance, with Section 409A of the Code (including any transition or grandfather rules thereunder).
(b) No Impermissible Acceleration or Deferral.
Neither the Executive nor the Company shall take any action to accelerate or delay the payment of any monies and/or provision of any benefits that are subject to Section 409A of the Code in any matter which would not be in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
A separation from service shall not occur under Section 409A of the Code unless the Executive has completely severed his employment or contractor relationship with the Company or the Executive has permanently decreased his services (via his employment relationship or his consulting relationship) to less than fifty percent (50%) of the average level of bona fide services over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period (or the full period if the Executive has been providing services for less than thirty-six (36) months).
If the Executive is deemed on the date of separation from service with the Company to be a “specified employee”, within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code and using the identification methodology selected by the Company from time to time, or if none, the default methodology, then with regard to any payment or benefit that is required to be delayed in compliance with Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the Executive’s separation from service or (ii) the date of the Executive’s death (the “409A Deferral Period”).
With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, except as permitted by Section 409A of the Code, (i) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits, provided during any taxable year of the Executive shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year of the Executive, provided that (ii) above shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Section 105(b) of the Code solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect.
For purposes of this Agreement, all rights to payments and benefits hereunder shall be treated as rights to receive a series of separate payments and benefits to the fullest extent allowed by Section 409A of the Code.
(h) Taxes, Interest and Penalties Are Obligation of the Executive.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall not be liable to the Executive if any payment or benefit which is to be provided pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise and which is considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code fails to comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.25.
The Executive agrees that any incentive-based compensation or award the Executive receives, or has received, from the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, is subject to clawback by the Company as required by applicable federal law and on such basis as the Board of Directors of the Company determines.26.
TARP and Other Federal Law.
The Executive agrees that any and all compensation or awards the Executive receives, or has received, from the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, are subject to limitations and/or prohibitions as may be required by the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program created by the Treasury Department pursuant to authority granted under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended from time to time, or by other applicable federal law and on such basis as the Board of Directors of the Company determines.27.
Except as provided in the next sentence, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters addressed herein and it supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement including, without limitation, agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date.
It is specifically agreed and acknowledged that, except as provided herein, the Executive shall not be entitled to severance payments or benefits under any severance or similar plan, program, arrangement or agreement of or with the Employer or the Company for any cessation of employment occurring while this Agreement is in effect.
