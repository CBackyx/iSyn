(i) General.
The Company and the Executive acknowledge that they will agree to provide the Company with the right to require the Executive and other executives of the Company to waive any registration rights with regard to such Shares upon an IPO, in which case the Company will implement an IPO bonus plan in cash, stock or additional options to compensate for the Executive’s and the other executives’ loss of liquidity; provided that if the Executive’s employment is terminated either due to death or Disability, by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason, then the Executive shall fully vest upon the date of termination in any grant made under such IPO bonus plan.

Termination.
(a) Termination of Employment by the Company.
The Executive’s employment hereunder may be terminated by the Company (or by the Board in the case of a termination with Cause) for any reason or no reason (including with or without Cause or timely notification by the Company at any time during the Employment Term pursuant to Section 2 that the Company intends to terminate the Agreement and the Executive’s employment, rather than allow the Agreement to renew automatically) by written notice as provided in Section 18.
If the Company terminates the Executive’s employment with Cause, all of the Executive’s Option Rights, whether or not vested, will be immediately forfeited and any unvested Restricted Shares shall be immediately forfeited as of the date of termination.
For all terminations (other than for Cause as set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to certain equity awards), the Executive shall be entitled to any amounts or benefits which are vested or have been earned or are due and remain unpaid, including, without limitation, base salary through the date of termination, any unreimbursed business expense, any bonus payment for any performance period which has ended prior to the date of termination for which the Executive has not been paid and any vested portion of the Executive’s outstanding equity awards.
In addition, upon any termination, the Executive shall remain entitled to the payments and benefits under Sections 10, 16 and 20 of this Agreement.
(b) Voluntary Termination by the Executive.
The Executive may voluntarily terminate the Executive’s employment with or without Good Reason at any time by notice to the Company as provided in Section 18.
Subject to Section 9 and any benefit continuation requirements of applicable laws, in the event the Executive’s employment hereunder is terminated for any reason whatsoever, the compensation and benefits obligations of the Company under Sections 4 and 5 shall cease as of the effective date of such termination, except for any compensation and benefits earned but unpaid through such date.
Upon termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason prior to an IPO, the Company will have the right to purchase any of the Executive’s Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stockholders Agreement.
(e) Resignation from All Positions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon the termination of the Executive’s employment for any reason, unless otherwise requested by the Board or the Reporting Person, the Executive shall immediately resign from all positions that he holds with the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their affiliates (and with any other entities with respect to which the Company has requested the Executive to perform services), as applicable, including, without limitation, the Board and all boards of directors of any affiliates.

Termination Payments and Benefits.
If, during the Employment Term, the Executive’s employment hereunder is terminated by the Company without Cause, by reason of the Executive’s death or Disability or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, subject to (i) the Executive’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims against the Company within 60 days following the date of the Executive’s termination of employment, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, (ii) the terms of Section 14 and (iii) the Executive’s continued compliance with the covenants of Sections 11 and 12 (collectively, the “Restrictive Covenants”) as set forth in Section 9(h), during the Payment Period, then in such case the Company shall be obligated to pay to the Executive such payments and make available to the Executive such benefits as are set forth in this Section 9 during the Payment Period.
(a) Cash Severance.
Termination Payments shall be paid to the Executive in accordance with the Company’s payroll schedule as in effect on the Effective Date for the duration of the Payment Period.
In the event that the Executive dies while any Termination Payments are still payable to the Executive hereunder, unless otherwise provided herein, all such unpaid amounts shall be paid, not later than the tenth (10th) business day following the Executive’s death, to the Executive’s beneficiary as named on the Executive’s 401(k) Plan beneficiary forms, or, if no such beneficiary is so named, then to the Executive’s estate, in the form of a lump sum cash payment equal to the remaining Termination Payments.
Notwithstanding the above, if such termination occurs upon or within the one-year period after a Change of Control (provided that such Change of Control constitutes a “change in control event” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), subject to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the lead-in paragraph of this Section 9, the Termination Payments shall be paid in a single lump sum to the Executive on the 65th day following the date of termination.
(b) Bonus Entitlement.
Solely if the Executive’s termination of employment occurs after the last day of the first quarter of an applicable Company fiscal year, the Executive will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the product of (i) the bonus that would have been paid to the Executive had the Executive remained employed through the date on which bonuses are paid to senior executives of the Company generally based upon the achievement of the applicable performance goals (or based on the applicable guaranteed amount set forth in Section 4(b)) and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days which have elapsed from the first day of the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs through the date of termination and the denominator of which is 365 (such amount, if any, the “Pro-Rata Bonus”), which Pro-Rata Bonus shall be paid within the first seventy-five (75) days of the year immediately following the end of the year to which such Pro-Rata Bonus relates (unless the Executive has deferred receipt of the applicable bonus).
6
During the 12-month period following the date of termination of employment, the Company shall maintain in full force and effect for the continued benefit of the Executive and his eligible dependents all health care benefit plans, except disability coverage, in which the Executive and his eligible dependents were entitled to participate immediately prior to the Executive’s termination or shall arrange to make available to the Executive and such dependents health care benefits (except disability coverage) substantially similar to those which the Executive and such dependents would otherwise have been entitled to receive if his employment had not been terminated (the “Welfare Benefits”).
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 9, in the event that the Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) on the date of termination of Executive’s employment with the Company and the Termination Payments to be paid within the first six months following such date (the “Initial Payment Period”) exceed the amount referenced in Treas.
Regs.
Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) (the “Limit”) and do not otherwise qualify under the short-term deferral exemption, then (i) any portion of the Termination Payments that is payable during the Initial Payment Period that does not exceed the Limit or can be paid within the short-term deferral exemption shall be paid at the times set forth in Section 9(a), (ii) any portion of the Termination Payments that exceeds the Limit and cannot be paid within the short-term deferral exemption (and would have been payable during the Initial Payment Period but for the Limit) shall be paid, with Interest, on the first business day of the first calendar month that begins after the six-month anniversary of Executive’s “separation from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) and (iii) any portion of the Termination Payments that is payable after the Initial Payment Period shall be paid at the times set forth in Section 9(a), respectively.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive dies while any Termination Payments are still payable to the Executive hereunder, unless otherwise provided herein, all such unpaid amounts shall be paid, not later than the tenth (10th) business day following the Executive’s death, to the Executive’s beneficiary as named on the Executive’s 401(k) Plan beneficiary forms, or, if no such beneficiary is so named, then to the Executive’s estate, in the form of a lump sum cash payment equal to the remaining Termination Payments.
The Executive is under no obligation to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for hereunder by seeking other employment or otherwise and, except with respect to the Welfare Benefits or as provided for in Section 9(h) below, no Termination Payments shall be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.
7
Not in any way in limitation of any right or remedy otherwise available to the Company, if the Executive does not materially comply with any of the Restrictive Covenants, as determined in writing by the Board (subject to the Board providing the Executive with written notice of any such material non-compliance), (i) the Termination Payments, the Pro-Rata Bonus and the Welfare Benefits (but for the avoidance of doubt excluding any equity awards) then or thereafter due from the Company to the Executive shall be terminated immediately, (ii) the Company’s obligation to pay or provide and the Executive’s right to receive such payments or benefits shall terminate and be of no further force or effect and (iii) the Executive shall be required to pay back to the Company an amount equal to any Termination Payments or amounts in respect of the Pro-Rata Bonus previously paid to him, in each case, without limiting or affecting the Executive’s obligations under the Restrictive Covenants or the Company’s other rights and remedies available at law or equity.10.
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the “Gross-Up Payment”) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income and employment taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
The Company’s obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 10 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive’s termination of employment.

Upon termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company, the Executive will return to the Company any such documents or other property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates which are in the possession, custody or control of the Executive.
12
(d) Upon a Change of Control, the definition of Company Group and their respective employees and independent contractors for the purpose of this Section 12 shall refer only to the Company, its Subsidiaries and its affiliates (and the business in which they were engaged) as of immediately prior to such Change of Control.
Each payment under this Agreement, including each installment of the Termination Payment, shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A.
13
(c) The Company and the Executive shall take all steps necessary (including with regard to any post-termination services the Executive provides) to ensure that any termination of employment described in this Agreement constitutes a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the date on which such “separation from service” takes place shall be the date of the termination of the Executive’s employment.15.
Effectiveness.
