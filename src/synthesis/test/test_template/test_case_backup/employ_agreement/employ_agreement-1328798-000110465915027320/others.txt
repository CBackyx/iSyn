The Executive’s title shall be President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of Parent’s Global Power Group, or such other titles of at least equivalent level consistent with the Executive’s duties from time to time as may be assigned to the Executive by the Company consistent with such position, and the Executive shall have all authorities as are customarily and ordinarily exercised by executives in similar positions in similar businesses of similar size in the United States.
The Executive hereby accepts such employment and agrees to render the services described above.
During the Term, and consistent with the above, the Executive agrees to serve the Company faithfully and to the best of the Executive’s ability, to devote the Executive’s entire business time, energy and skill to such employment, and to use the Executive’s best efforts, skill and ability to promote the Company’s interests.

It is agreed that any direct or indirect interest in, connection with, or benefit from any outside activities, particularly commercial activities, which interest might in any way adversely affect Company, involves a possible conflict of interest.
