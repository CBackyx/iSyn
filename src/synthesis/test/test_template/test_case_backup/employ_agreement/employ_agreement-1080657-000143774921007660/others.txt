The Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such proceeding and the Executive will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with such defense.
To the extent that the Executive in good faith determines that there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Company and the Executive in connection with the defense of a proceeding, the Executive shall so notify the Company and shall be entitled to separate representation at the Company’s expense by counsel selected by the Executive (provided that the Company may reasonably object to the selection of counsel within ten (10) business days after notification thereof) which counsel shall cooperate, and coordinate the defense, with the Company’s counsel and minimize the expense of such separate representation to the extent consistent with the Executive’s separate defense and to the extent possible and consistent with all applicable rules of legal ethics.
