(a) Seller may not assign, transfer, sell or subcontract all or any part of this Agreement, any interest herein, or any of the Seller’s interest in the Servicing Spread Collections, other than the interest in the Total Servicing Spread sold hereby, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, provided that any successor to Seller must assume Seller’s obligations under this Agreement.
Purchaser shall have the unrestricted right to further assign, transfer, deliver, hypothecate, pledge, subdivide or otherwise deal with its rights under this Agreement on whatever terms Purchaser shall determine without the consent of Seller; including the right to assign all or any portion of the Current Excess Servicing Spread and to assign the related rights under this Agreement.
If Purchaser assigns any rights under this Agreement to a third party (a “Third Party Assignment”), such third party (a “Third Party Assignee”) shall enter into a new agreement (a “Third Party Current Spread Agreement”) with Seller or Seller’s assignee that provides such Third Party Assignee with the same rights with respect to the Current Excess Servicing Spread that Purchaser would have had under this Agreement if the Third Party Assignment had not occurred.
In the event this agreement is terminated as set forth in the prior sentence or in Section 8.13, neither Party shall have any further obligations to the other Party hereunder except as expressly set forth herein.
