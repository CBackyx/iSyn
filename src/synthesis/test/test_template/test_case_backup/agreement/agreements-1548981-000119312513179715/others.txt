3.7 Earned and Accrued Bonus.
For purposes of this Agreement, with respect to “Earned and Accrued Bonus” payments to be made to the Executive in connection with the termination of his employment, Annual Bonus payments and other cash bonus payments and Equity Compensation awards shall be deemed to be “earned and accrued” (a) if the Executive is employed with the Company as of the date of the last day of the period for which a bonus payment shall be made or for which Equity Compensation is vested, if the Executive is employed with the Company as of the date such vested award or vesting is scheduled to occur; and (b) to the extent that the criteria or performance goals for determining the amount of such payment or award are objective and measurable criteria, and such objective and measurable criteria have been satisfied or achieved.
Earned and Accrued Bonus specifically includes, without limitation, any bonus payments payable to Executive under any approved bonus plan or arrangement and any Equity Compensation that is awarded and vested.
Upon the occurrence of a “Change in Control” (as such term is defined in the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and in effect as of the Effective Date hereof), all Equity Compensation awarded to the Executive under this Agreement, to the extent not vested as of the date of the Change in Control or to the extent that any such award is subject to forfeiture restrictions as of the date of the Change in Control, shall, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Change in Control, be deemed vested and all forfeiture restrictions shall lapse (treating any applicable performance criteria as fully satisfied).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary for the Executive to avoid taxes and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”), a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur unless it constitutes a “change in control event” within the meaning of Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Tax Code.4.
Termination of Employment.
The survival provisions of this Agreement described at Section 7.15 contemplate without limitation that upon the termination of his or her employment the Executive shall be subject to the provisions of the Covenant Against Competition set forth in Section 6.2.4.1 Termination upon the Executive’s Death or Disability.
5
(c) Upon the Executive’s death or the termination of the Executive’s employment by virtue of disability, all of the following shall apply:(i) the Executive, or the Executive’s estate or beneficiaries in the case of the death of the Executive, shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder on and after the effective date of the termination of employment, except that the Company shall reimburse Executive’s COBRA premium under the Company’s major medical group health and dental plan (including the costs of Executive’s premium required to maintain coverage for his dependents), and the Company will continue to provide such additional continuing benefits (including without limitation life insurance benefits) as the Executive and his dependents would have been entitled to under this Agreement, as on a monthly basis for a period of eighteen (18) months after the termination, and the Executive, or the Executive’s estate or beneficiaries in the case of the death of the Executive, shall be entitled to receive the Executive’s Annual Salary and other benefits that are earned and accrued under this Agreement prior to the date of termination, the Executive’s Earned and Accrued Bonuses, vesting of or lapsing of any forfeiture restrictions on any Equity Compensation as provided in clause (ii) below, reimbursement under this Agreement for expenses incurred prior to the date of such termination; provided, that if the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Tax Code, any payments of “deferred compensation” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(1), after giving effect to the exemptions in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(3) through (b)(12)), shall not commence until the first day of the seventh month beginning after the date of the Executive’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), or, if earlier, within 15 days after the appointment of the personal representative or executor of the Executive’s estate following his or her death if a delay in payment is required, to avoid the imposition of the additional 20% tax under Section 409A of the Tax Code (and in the case of installment payments, the first payment shall include all installment payments required by this subsection that otherwise would have been made during such period).
The payments to be made in this Section 4.1(c) shall be in addition to, rather than in lieu of, the entitlement of Executive or his estate to any other insurance or benefit proceeds as a result of his death or disability.4.2 Termination by the Company for Cause.

Severance Package for Certain Terminations of Employment.
If, at the time of a termination to which this sub-subparagraph b(i) applies, at least three full fiscal years have not occurred, then to the extent necessary to calculate the Average Annual Bonus for the last three years as set forth above, the initial Target Level shall be used for the missing years).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Tax Code, any payments of “deferred compensation” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A- 10
1(b)(1), after giving effect to the exemptions in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(3) through (b)(12)), shall not commence until the first day of the seventh month beginning after the date of the Executive’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) to avoid the imposition of the additional 20% tax under Section 409A of the Tax Code (and in the case of installment payments, the first payment shall include all installment payments required by this subsection that otherwise would have been made during such period); and(ii) for a period of eighteen (18) months after termination of employment, the Company shall reimburse Executive’s COBRA premium under the Company’s major medical group health and dental plan (including the costs of Executive’s premium required to maintain coverage for his dependents), and the Company will provide such additional continuing health, dental, disability and life insurance benefits applicable to senior executives of the Company generally as the Executive and his dependents would have received under this Agreement (and for such additional benefits, at such costs to the Company, provided that the value of premiums on all primary or supplemental disability policies shall be taxed as income to the Executive) as would have applied in the absence of such termination or expiration (but not taking into account any post-termination increases in Annual Salary that may otherwise have occurred without regard to such termination and that may have favorably affected such benefits), it being expressly understood and agreed that nothing in this clause (b)(ii) shall restrict the ability of the Company to generally amend or terminate such plans and programs from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Company shall in no event be required to provide such reimbursements or coverage after such time as the Executive becomes entitled to receive health benefits from another employer or recipient of the Executive’s services (and provided, further, that such entitlement shall be determined without regard to any individual waivers or other arrangements);(iii) all of the Equity Compensation awarded to the Executive, to the extent not vested or to the extent subject to forfeiture restrictions as of the date of the termination of the Executive’s employment, shall immediately be deemed vested and any forfeiture restrictions shall immediately lapse (treating the performance criteria for the year of termination as fully satisfied), and any outstanding options to acquire shares of Company stock shall immediately be vested and shall be, as determined in the discretion of the Board, either (A) exercisable by the Executive or, in the case of the Executive’s death, by the beneficiaries of Executive’s estate, for one (1) year following the termination (or, if shorter, the balance of the regular term of the options), or (B) cashed out or cancelled, as if in accordance with a Change in Control event, pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 15.03 of the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan as in effect on the Effective Date hereof.Unless a later payment date is required under Code section 409A (as described above or pursuant to Section 7.20 of this Agreement), payments due under the Severance Package shall be paid to the Executive (or installment payments shall commence) on the fiftieth (50th) day following the date of the termination event.

Notwithstanding the above, software, methods and material developed by the Executive prior to the Term of the Agreement shall not be the Company’s property.6.3 Rights and Remedies upon Breach.
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that any breach by him of any of the provisions of Sections 6.1 or 6.2 (the “Restrictive Covenants”) would result in irreparable injury and damage for which money damages would not provide an adequate remedy.
Therefore, if the Executive breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, the Company and its affiliates shall have the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced (without posting bond and without the need to prove damages) by any court having equity jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the right to an entry against the Executive of restraining orders and injunctions (preliminary, mandatory, temporary and permanent) against violations, threatened or actual, and whether or not then continuing, of such covenants.

The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Executive has had an opportunity to seek advice of counsel in connection with this Agreement and that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects.
If it is determined that any of the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of this Agreement shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full affect, without regard to the invalid portions.7.2 Duration and Scope of Covenants.
If any court or other decision maker of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the Executive’s covenants contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the duration or geographical scope of such provision, then, after such determination has become final and unappealable, the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, shall be reduced so that such provision becomes enforceable and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.
14
7.3 Enforceability of Restrictive Covenants; Jurisdictions.
The Company and the Executive intend to and hereby consent to jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of the Restrictive Covenants.
If the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants wholly unenforceable by reason of breadth of scope or otherwise it is the intention of the Company and the Executive that such determination not bar or in any way affect the Company’s right, or the right of any of its affiliates, to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such Restrictive Covenants, as to breaches of such Restrictive Covenants in such other respective jurisdictions, such Restrictive Covenants as they relate to each jurisdiction’s being, for this purpose, severable, diverse and independent covenants, subject, where appropriate, to the doctrine of res judicata.7.4 Arbitration.
Except with respect to any claims or disputes arising from or relating to the Restrictive Covenants or arising after a Change in Control, any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration, to be held in Phoenix, Arizona in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules, as amended from time to time, of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).

If the arbitrators selected by the Company and the Executive are unable to agree on a third arbitrator within that period, then either the Company or the Executive may request that the AAA select the third arbitrator.
The arbitrators will possess substantive legal experience in the principle issues in dispute and will be independent of the Company and the Executive.
To the extent permitted by applicable law and not prohibited by the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the Company will pay all expenses (including the reasonable expenses of the Executive, including his reasonable legal fees, if the Executive is the prevailing party in such arbitration) incurred in connection with arbitration and the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and will advance such expenses from time to time as required.
Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by the parties or as ordered by the arbitrators upon substantial justification shown, the hearing for the dispute will be held within 60 days of submission of the dispute to arbitration.
The arbitrators will state the factual and legal basis for the award.
The decision of the arbitrators will be final and binding and not subject to judicial review and final judgment may be entered upon such an award in any court of competent jurisdiction, but entry of such judgment will not be required to make such award effective.7.5 Attorneys’ Fees.
If litigation after a Change in Control shall be brought to enforce or interpret any provision contained herein, the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law and not prohibited by the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, shall indemnify the Executive for the Executive’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements incurred in such litigation if the Executive is the prevailing party in such litigation.7.6 Notices.
