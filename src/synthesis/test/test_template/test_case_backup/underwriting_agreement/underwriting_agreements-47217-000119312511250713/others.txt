statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) were not appropriately responsive in all material respects with requirements of the Act and the rules thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, as of the most recent Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case except for the financial statements and the notes thereto and the financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) and (iii) that the Disclosure Package, considered together, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstance under which they were made, not misleading (except the financial statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view).Any of the statements described above may be omitted from the opinion of such counsel; provided, however, that in such event the Company shall also have furnished to the Representatives the corresponding opinion or statement of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel for the Company, described in subsection 5(b)(ii) below.

11
(2) inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.As a result of the foregoing procedures nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:(A) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;(B) the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; or(C) the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2010, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
(ii) they have read the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, board of directors, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee or obtained a summary of topics discussed at such meetings for the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement;(iii) they have performed certain other procedures as a result of which they determined that the information described in a letter to be delivered to the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information that has been obtained from accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation) set forth in the Registration Statement, as amended, the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement (including selected accounting, financial or statistical information included or therein), agrees with accounting records or schedules made from such accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation.
(f) Subsequent to the respective dates of which information is given in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement on or after the Execution Time), there shall not have been (i) 13
any material change in the capital stock (other than upon exercise of outstanding stock options) or any significant increase in long-term debt of the Company or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates and selling agents and each person who controls any Underwriter, its affiliates and selling agents within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(h) hereof, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for 14
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives for use in connection with the preparation thereof.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have.
The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the third and sixth paragraphs under the heading “Underwriting” of the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under this Section 6 or otherwise.
In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.
Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, 15
however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 6, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action.
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company or the Underwriters on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters.
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and 16
each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph (d).
Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify in writing such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth on Schedule II hereto, and not joint.7.
Default by an Underwriter.
In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 7, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.8.
Termination.
hostilities or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Securities.9.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive.
The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company and the Underwriters shall remain responsible for their respective expenses and reimbursements pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.10.
Successors.
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.12.
Applicable Law.
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.13.
Arm’s Length Transaction.
The company acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is acting solely in the capacity of an arm’s length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or any agent of, the Company or any other person.
Additionally, no Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction.
The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.
Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
