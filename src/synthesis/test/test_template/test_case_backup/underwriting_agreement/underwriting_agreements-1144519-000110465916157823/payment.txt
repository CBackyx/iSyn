BNP Paribas
Bunge Finance Europe B.V., a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) organized under the laws of The Netherlands (the “Company”), proposes to issue and sell to the several Underwriters listed in Schedule I hereto (collectively, the “Underwriters”) an additional €200,000,000 principal amount of its 1.850% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Securities”).
The Company previously issued €600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.850% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Existing Securities”) under the Indenture.
The Company hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters, and each Underwriter, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the principal amount of the Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto opposite its name at a purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of 102.373% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest for the period from (and including) June 16, 2016 to, but not including, the Closing Date (as defined in Section 4).
Payment and Delivery.
The Company will deliver against payment of the Purchase Price the Securities in the form of Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of a CSK located outside the United States for Clearstream and Euroclear.
Payment for the Securities shall be made by the Underwriters in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Common Service Provider for the account of the Company at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017, at 9:00 A.M. (New York time) on November 17, 2016, or at such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor determine, such time being referred to as the “Closing Date,” against delivery to the Common Service Provider for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Global Security representing all of the Securities.
Each Underwriter agrees to pay the portion of such expenses represented by such Underwriter’s pro rata share (based on the proportion that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter’s name in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all Underwriters) of the Securities (with respect to each Underwriter, the “Pro Rata Expenses”).
If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder, such Underwriter or controlling person agrees to pay to the Guarantor an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder.
