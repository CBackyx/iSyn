The Company and the Guarantor have complied and will comply with Rule 433.

Each of the Company and the Guarantor will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(e)                          Not to take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to
18
Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriter that the Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder.
(f)                           If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the General Disclosure Package conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the General Disclosure Package so that the statements in the General Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the General Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the General Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(g)                         If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Securities as in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Guarantor) to which Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or
19
so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(h)                         To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request.
(i)                             To use reasonable best efforts to assist the Underwriters in arranging for the Securities to be eligible for clearance and settlement through Euroclear and Clearstream and to maintain such eligibility for so long as the Securities remain outstanding.
(j)                             To use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Securities to be admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to be admitted for trading on the Exchange on or about the Closing Date.
(k)                         To make generally available to the Guarantor’s shareholders and to you as soon as practicable an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Guarantor occurring after the date of this Agreement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(l)                             Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to pay or cause to be paid all reasonable expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company’s and the Guarantor’s counsel and the Guarantor’s accountants in connection with the registration and delivery of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company or the Guarantor and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including the filing fees payable to the Commission relating to the Securities (within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1), if applicable), all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers, in the quantities hereinabove specified, (ii) all costs and expenses related to the transfer and delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters, including any transfer, stamp, or other issuance taxes payable thereon (including any such costs and expenses related to the Guarantee), (iii) the cost of printing or producing any Blue Sky or legal investment
20
memorandum in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities under state securities laws and all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 6(h) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or legal investment memorandum, (iv) all filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection with the review and qualification of the offering of the Securities by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and all fees and expenses related to the listing of the Securities on the Exchange, (v) the cost of printing certificates representing the Securities, (vi) the costs and charges of any trustee, paying agent, registrar or depositary, (vii) the costs and expenses of the Company and the Guarantor relating to investor presentations on any “road show,” if any, undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Securities, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the Company and the Guarantor, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the Company and the Guarantor and any such consultants, and one-half of the cost of any aircraft chartered in connection with the road show, and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company and the Guarantor hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section.
It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section, Section 7 entitled “Indemnity and Contribution,” and the last paragraph of Section 9 below, the Underwriters will pay all of their costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their counsel and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the International Capital Markets Association Primary Market Handbook, each Underwriter hereby agrees that the Settlement Lead Manager may allocate the Pro Rata Expenses to the account of such Underwriter for settlement of accounts (including payment of such Underwriter’s fees by the Settlement Lead Manager) as soon as practicable but in any case no later than 90 days following the Closing Date.
(m)                          Each of the Company and the Guarantor represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of each Underwriter, and
21
each Underwriter agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Guarantor, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a “free writing prospectus,” as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission.
Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Guarantor and each Underwriter, including those identified on Schedule I hereto, is hereinafter referred to as a “Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.”  Each of the Company and the Guarantor represents that it has treated and agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely Commission filing where required, legending and record keeping.
Any such final term sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
Each of the Company and the Guarantor also consents to the use by the Underwriters of a free writing prospectus that contains only (i)(x) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering or (y) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in the final term sheet of the Company and the Guarantor contemplated in the first sentence of this subsection or (ii) other information that is not “issuer information,” as defined in Rule 433, it being understood that any such free writing prospectus referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above shall not be an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
7.
Indemnity and Contribution.
(a)                               The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment
22
thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Company or Guarantor information that the Company or Guarantor has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Guarantor in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
(b)                              Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor, the directors of the Company and Guarantor, the officers of the Company and Guarantor who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Guarantor in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by you consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the information contained in the fifth and sixth paragraphs under the caption “Underwriting”.
In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
23
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.
It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Underwriters and all persons, if any, who control the Underwriters within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, the Guarantor and their respective directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either such Section.
The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d)                             To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as
24
well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities.
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Underwriters’ respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e)                               The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d).
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
25
(f)                                The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantor contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Guarantor, and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
8.
Termination.
9.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters.
This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such
26
Underwriter.
In any such case either you, the Company or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the General Disclosure Package, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability to the Company and the Guarantor or any non-defaulting Underwriter in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
10.
Submission to Jurisdiction; Appointment of Agent for Service.
The Guarantor irrevocably agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding brought by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, the State of New York and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding and any claim of inconvenient forum, and irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action or proceeding.
To the extent that the Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise) from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process with respect to itself or its property in respect of its obligations under this Agreement, the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such immunity in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding.
Each of the parties hereto hereby waives any right to trial by jury in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
27
The Guarantor (i) irrevocably designates and appoints its Chief Financial Officer from time to time located at its principal executive offices at 50 Main Street, White Plains, New York 10606 (together with any successor, the “Guarantor’s Authorized Agent”), as its agent upon which process may be served in any suit, action or proceeding described in the first sentence of this Section 10 and represents and warrants that the Guarantor’s Authorized Agent has accepted such designation, and (ii) agrees that service of process upon the Guarantor’s Authorized Agent and written notice of said service to the Guarantor mailed or delivered to its Secretary at its registered office at 2 Church Street, Hamilton, Bermuda, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Guarantor in any such suit or proceeding.
The Guarantor further agrees to take any and all action, including the execution and filing of any and all such documents and instruments, as may be necessary to continue such designation and appointment of the Guarantor’s Authorized Agent in full force and effect so long as any of the Securities shall be issued and outstanding.
11.
Entire Agreement; Arms-Length Relationship.
(a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
(b) Each of the Company and the Guarantor acknowledges that, solely in connection with the offering of the Securities, any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the Guarantor and its subsidiaries or any other due diligence review by the Underwriters will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company, the Guarantor or its subsidiaries, and that, solely in connection with this offering of the Securities, the Underwriters (i) have acted at arms’ length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company, the Guarantor or any other person, (ii) owe the Company and the Guarantor only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) may have interests that differ from those of the Company or the Guarantor.
Each of the Company and the Guarantor waives, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.

15.
Judgment Currency.
If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures an Underwriter could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.
The obligation of the Guarantor with respect to any sum due from it to any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, be discharged only if and to the extent that on the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Underwriter may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency.
If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter hereunder, the Guarantor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person against such loss.
16.
Taxes.
All payments to be made by the Company or the Guarantor under this Agreement shall be paid free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, “Taxes”) unless required by law.
If any Taxes are required by law to be deducted or withheld in connection with such payments, the Guarantor will increase the amount paid as necessary so that the Underwriters will receive the full amount of such payment as if no such deduction or withholding had been required; provided however, no additional amounts will be paid in respect or on account of any Taxes that are imposed or withheld: (i) due to the failure of an Underwriter to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (as applicable); or (ii) pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Stabilization.
The Company and the Guarantor hereby authorize J.P. Morgan Securities plc as the “Stabilizing Manager” to make adequate public disclosure regarding stabilization of the information required in relation to such stabilization by the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation 596/2014) of the Commission of the European Communities.
The Stabilizing Manager for its own account may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and directives, over-allot and effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Securities at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail, but in doing so the Stabilizing Manager shall act as principal and not as agent of the Company or the Guarantor and any loss resulting from overallotment and stabilization shall be borne, and any profit arising therefrom shall be beneficially retained, by the Stabilizing Manager.

Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed so as to require the Company to issue in excess of the aggregate principal amount of Securities specified in Schedule I hereto.
Such stabilization, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time and shall be conducted by the Stabilizing Manager in accordance with all applicable laws and directives.
The Stabilizing Manager is hereby appointed to act as central point responsible for the public disclosure requirements referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 6 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No.
2016/1052, and for handling any request from any of the competent authorities referred to in paragraph 4 therein.

The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates.
Before you invest, you should read the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus related to that registration statement and other documents that Bunge Limited, the Guarantor, has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering.
A-3
EXHIBIT B
1.
The Guarantor is duly incorporated and existing under the laws of Bermuda in good standing (meaning solely that it has not failed to make any filing with any Bermuda governmental authority, or to pay any Bermuda government fee or tax, which would make it liable to be struck off the Register of Companies and thereby cease to exist under the laws of Bermuda).
2.
The Guarantor has the necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Documents and the necessary corporate power to conduct its business as described under the captions “Bunge Limited” in the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement.
The execution and delivery of the Documents by the Guarantor and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations thereunder will not violate the memorandum of association or bye-laws of the Guarantor nor any applicable law, regulation, order or decree in Bermuda.
3.
The Guarantor has taken all corporate action required to authorise its execution and filing of the Registration Statement and its execution, delivery and performance of the Documents.
The Registration Statement has been duly executed by or on behalf of the Guarantor.
The Documents have been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Guarantor, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with the terms thereof.
4.
No order, consent, approval, licence, authorisation or validation of, filing with or exemption by any government or public body or authority of Bermuda or any sub division thereof is required to authorise or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance and enforcement of the Documents, except such as have been duly obtained or filed in accordance with Bermuda law.
5.
It is not necessary or desirable to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda of the Documents that they be registered in any register kept by, or filed with, any governmental authority or regulatory body in Bermuda.
However, to the extent that any of the Documents creates a charge over assets of the Guarantor, it may be desirable to ensure the priority in Bermuda of the charge that it be registered in the Register of Charges in accordance with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981.
On registration, to the extent that Bermuda law governs the priority of a charge, such charge will have priority in Bermuda over any unregistered charges, and over any subsequently registered charges, in respect of the assets which are the subject of the charge.
B-1
While there is no exhaustive definition of a charge under Bermuda law, a charge includes any interest created in property by way of security (including any mortgage, assignment, pledge, lien or hypothecation).
As the Documents are governed by the Foreign Laws, the question of whether they create such an interest in property would be determined under the Foreign Laws.
6.
Based solely upon a search of the Cause Book of the Supreme Court of Bermuda conducted at [·] a.m. on [·], 2016 (which would not reveal details of proceedings which have been filed but not actually entered in the Cause Book at the time of such search), there are no judgments against the Guarantor, nor any legal or governmental proceedings pending in Bermuda to which the Guarantor is subject.
7.
The authorised capital of the Guarantor conforms, as to legal matters, to the description thereof contained in each of the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus in all material respects.
8.
The statements contained in the Base Prospectus under the caption “Description of Share Capital”, to the extent that they constitute statements of Bermuda law, are accurate in all material respects as of the date of the Base Prospectus.
The statements contained in (i) each of the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement under the captions “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to this Offering - The notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt”, “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to this Offering – Bunge Limited is a holding company and will depend upon funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the guarantee of the notes”, “Description of the Notes” and “Taxation – Bermuda Tax Considerations”, and (ii) the Guarantor’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2015 under the caption “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Common Shares - We are a Bermuda company, and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us and our directors and executive officers”, to the extent that they constitute statements of Bermuda law, are accurate in all material respects.
9.
The Documents will not be subject to ad valorem stamp duty in Bermuda and no registration, documentary, recording, transfer or other similar tax, fee or charge is payable in Bermuda in connection with the execution, delivery, filing, registration or performance of the Documents.
10.
There is no income or other tax of Bermuda imposed by withholding or otherwise on any payment to be made by the Guarantor pursuant to the Documents.
11.
The Guarantor has received an assurance from the Minister of Finance in Bermuda that in the event of there being enacted in Bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset,
B-2
gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to the Guarantor or any of its operations or its shares, debentures or other obligations (subject to the proviso expressed in such assurance as described in the Prospectus), which assurance is effective until 31 March 2035.
12.
The choice of the Foreign Laws as the governing law of the Documents is a valid choice of law and would be recognised and given effect to in any action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in Bermuda, except for those laws (i) which such court considers to be procedural in nature, (ii) which are revenue or penal laws or (iii) the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is interpreted under the laws of Bermuda.
The submission in the Documents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Foreign Courts and the appointment of its Chief Financial Officer from time to time by the Guarantor as its agent for service of legal process in connection with proceedings in the Foreign Courts pursuant to the Documents, is valid and binding upon the Guarantor.
13.
The courts of Bermuda would recognise as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the Foreign Courts against the Guarantor based upon the Documents under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) and would give a judgment based thereon provided that (a) such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment, (b) such courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of Bermuda, (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud, (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of Bermuda, (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of Bermuda and (f) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of Bermuda.
14.
The Guarantor is not entitled to any immunity under the laws of Bermuda, whether characterised as sovereign immunity or otherwise, from any legal proceedings to enforce the Documents in respect of itself or its property.
15.
The Guarantor has been designated as non resident of Bermuda for the purposes of the Exchange Control Act, 1972 and, as such, is free to acquire, hold, transfer and sell foreign currency (including the payment of dividends or other distributions) and securities without restriction.
B-3
EXHIBIT C
1.
The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor (to the extent execution and delivery of the Agreement by the Guarantor are governed by the laws of the State of New York).
2.
The execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantor of the Agreement does not, and the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their respective obligations thereunder will not, result in a violation of Generally Applicable Law.
3.
No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any United States federal or New York governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their respective obligations under the Agreement, except as have been obtained and are in full force and effect under the Securities Act or as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of any jurisdiction in the United States in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes by the Underwriters (as to which such counsel expresses no opinion).
4.
Under the laws of the State of New York relating to the submission to personal jurisdiction, the Guarantor has, pursuant to the Agreement, validly and irrevocably submitted to the personal jurisdiction of any New York state court or United States federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, and any appellate court thereof, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Agreement and validly and irrevocably waived any objection to the venue of a proceeding in any such court, and has validly appointed the authorized agent named in the Agreement for the purposes described therein, and service of process effected in the manner set forth in the Agreement will be effective to confer valid personal jurisdiction over the Guarantor.
Each of the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion), at the time it was filed with the Commission, appears on its face to have been appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (b) each of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained therein or omitted therefrom, and the Trustee’s Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion) appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and
C-1
the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and (c) such counsel does not know of any contract or other document of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement that is not so filed.
No facts came to our attention which caused us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Trustee’s Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to which such counsel has not been requested to comment), at the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel has not been requested to comment), at the Applicable Time or on the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel has not been requested to comment), as of its date and the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
C-2
EXHIBIT D
1.
Each subsidiary of the Guarantor listed in Annex A to this opinion (each, a “Significant Subsidiary”) has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation or company, and, if applicable, is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or company to transact business and, if applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
2.
Except as otherwise disclosed in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary of the Guarantor have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and are owned directly or indirectly by the Guarantor, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
3.
To the best of my knowledge, none of the Guarantor’s Significant Subsidiaries is presently (a) in violation of its charter or by-laws, except where the violation would not have a material adverse effect on such Significant Subsidiary, or is (b) in breach of any applicable statute, rule or regulation known to me, or to my knowledge, any order, writ or decree of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over such subsidiaries or over any of their properties or operations, except where the breach would not have a material adverse effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
4.
To the best of my knowledge, the execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantor of, the performance of their respective obligations under and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture (including the Guarantee set forth therein), the ICSD Agreement, the Agency Agreement and the Notes will not (x) result in any violation of their respective deed of incorporation, articles of association, memorandum of association or bye-laws, as the case may be, (y) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company and the Guarantor that is material to the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (z) result in the violation of any law or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or the Guarantor or any of its Significant
D-1
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of (y) and (z), for such conflicts, breaches or violations, as the case may be, that would not have a material adverse effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
5.
To the best of my knowledge, (a) there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company, the Guarantor or any of the Guarantor’s Significant Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company, the Guarantor or the Guarantor’s Significant Subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and are not so described, and (b) there are no statutes or regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus that are not described as required;

D-2
EXHIBIT E
1.
The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company under the laws of The Netherlands, the Indenture, the Additional Note, the Underwriting Agreement, the Agency Agreement and the ICSD Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by the Company (to the extent execution and delivery are governed by the laws of the State of New York).
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Guarantor under Bermuda law, the Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor (to the extent execution and delivery are governed by the laws of the State of New York).
Each of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement, the Agency Agreement and the ICSD Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
Each of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
2.
Assuming the Additional Note is duly authenticated by the Trustee, the Registrar or a duly appointed agent of the Trustee or the Registrar, as applicable, and effectuated by the relevant common safekeeper (the “CSK”) for Euroclear and Clearstream, as International Central Securities Depositaries, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and paid for by the Underwriters (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Additional Note constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture; provided that we express no opinion as to the validity, legality or enforceability of the obligations of the Trustee under the Indenture.
The form of the Additional Note complies with the requirements of the Indenture and based solely on our review of the Indenture and, as to factual matters only, the Certificates supplied by the Clients, all conditions to the issuance and authentication thereof set forth in the Indenture have been satisfied in full.
3.
Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Guarantor under Bermuda law, at such time as the Additional Note has been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered as provided in the Indenture and duly effectuated by the relevant CSK (to the extent execution and delivery are governed by the laws of the State of New York) and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantee is a valid and legally binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture; provided that we express no
E-1
opinion as to the validity, legality or enforceability of the obligations of the Trustee under the Indenture.
4.
No authorization, consent, approval or other action by, or filing with, any New York or United States federal regulatory body or New York or United States federal governmental agency or authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Indenture, Underwriting Agreement, the Agency Agreement, the ICSD Agreement and the Additional Note, or by the Guarantor of the Indenture, or for the validity or enforcement, of the Indenture, the Agency Agreement, the ICSD Agreement and the Additional Note, except (i) as have been obtained or effected as of the date hereof or (ii) such consents, approvals, authorizations or orders as are not required on the date hereof (under existing laws, regulations and conditions).
5.
The execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement, the Agency Agreement, the ICSD Agreement and the Additional Note, and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder will not breach, contravene, conflict with, or constitute a violation of any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States that in our experience is normally applicable to transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or, to our knowledge, any judgment, order or decree, applicable to the Company or any of its properties or assets.
6.
The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations thereunder will not breach, contravene, conflict with, or constitute a violation of any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States that in our experience is normally applicable to transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or, to our knowledge, any judgment, order or decree, applicable to the Guarantor or any of its properties or assets.
7.
Based upon our review of the indentures, mortgages, deeds of trust, loan agreements or other agreements or instruments set forth on Annex I attached to each of the Officers’ Certificates (collectively, the “Material Agreements”), the execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement, the Agency Agreement, the ICSD Agreement, the Additional Note and the Underwriting Agreement, the execution and delivery by the Guarantor of the Master Trust Guaranty, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, and the performance by either the Company or the Guarantor of its obligations thereunder do not (and, in the case of performance, under current terms will not) breach, contravene, conflict with, or constitute a violation of any Material Agreement by which the Company or the Guarantor is bound or to which any of its properties or assets is subject (except we express no opinion as to violations of financial covenants or similar provisions to the extent they require financial calculations to ascertain compliance).
E-2
8.
Neither the Company nor the Guarantor is, nor will either of them be, as a result of the Transactions, an “investment company” or a company “controlled by” an “investment company”, in each case within the meaning of and subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9.
Each of the Indenture, the Additional Note and the Master Trust Transaction Documents conforms in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
10.
Under the laws of the State of New York relating to submission to personal jurisdiction, the Company and the Guarantor have, pursuant to provisions of the Indenture, validly and irrevocably submitted to the personal jurisdiction of any New York State or U.S. federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and any appellate court thereof, in any suit, action or proceeding relating to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and have validly and irrevocably waived any objection to the venue of a proceeding in any such court, and have validly appointed the authorized agent named in the Indenture for the purposes described therein, and the service of process effected on such agent in the manner set forth in the Indenture is effective to confer valid personal jurisdiction over the Guarantor.
11.
We are of the opinion that, under current United States federal income tax law, the statements in the Prospectus under the caption “TAXATION – Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” to the extent they constitute summaries of matters of law or legal conclusions, fairly summarize the matters described therein in all material respects.
E-3
EXHIBIT F
1.
Status  The Company is duly incorporated and validly existing as a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) under Dutch law.

Authorised capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal):
Subscribed capital (geplaatst kapitaal):
Paid-up capital (gestort kapitaal):
3.
Shareholders  Bunge N.A.
Holdings, Inc. is the sole shareholder of the Company.
4.
Powers and authority  The Company has the corporate power and authority to enter into the Opinion Documents, to issue the Notes represented by the Global Note Certificates and perform the obligations expressed to be assumed by it under the Opinion Documents and the Notes represented by the Global Note Certificates and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorise the execution and delivery of the Opinion Documents and the issue of the Notes represented by the Global Note Certificates.
5.
6.
Application of New York law  The choice of the laws of the State of New York as the law governing the Opinion Documents and the Notes represented by the Global Note Certificates would be upheld as a valid and binding choice of law by Dutch courts and applied by those courts in proceedings in relation to the Opinion Documents and the Notes as the governing law thereof, except (i) to the extent that any term of the Opinion Documents or any provision of New York law applicable to the Opinion Documents or the Notes is manifestly incompatible with Dutch public policy and (ii) that mandatory provisions of Dutch law or the laws of another jurisdiction may be given effect by a Dutch court if and insofar as, under Dutch law or the laws of such other jurisdiction respectively those provisions must be applied irrespective of the chosen law.
However, none of the expressed provisions of the Opinion Documents or the Notes appears on its face to be manifestly incompatible with Dutch public policy or such mandatory provisions.
F-1
7          Legal validity  Subject to the opinion given under (f) above, the Opinion Documents and the Notes, represented by the Global Note Certificates, authenticated and effectuated (where required) in the manner set out in the Indenture and when delivered against payment as contemplated by the Opinion Documents, would be treated by Dutch courts as constituting legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company in accordance with their respective terms and the Opinion Documents and the Global Note Certificates are in proper form for their enforcement in Dutch courts.
8          Non-conflict with laws  Neither the execution by the Company of the Opinion Documents nor the performance by the Company of all its obligations thereunder, nor the issue of the Notes represented by the Global Note Certificates, nor the compliance by the Company with all the provisions of the Notes conflicts with or will result in a violation of (i) any provision of the Articles or (ii) the provisions of any published law, rule or regulation of general application of the Netherlands.
The execution and performance of the terms of the Opinion Documents by the Underwriters will not conflict with or result in a violation of the provisions of any published law, rule or regulation of general application in the Netherlands.
9          Consents  No authorisations, approvals, consents, licences, exemptions, filings, registrations, notarisations or other requirements of governmental, judicial or public bodies or authorities of or in the Netherlands are required in connection with the Company’s entry into or performance of the Opinion Documents or for the issue of the Notes, or for their validity or enforceability against the Company.
Any Underwriter wishing to offer Notes in the Netherlands must either be licensed or exempt under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht, the “FSA”) and any successor legislation thereto.
10        Submission to New York jurisdiction  The submission by the Company in the Opinion Documents and the Notes to jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York is valid and binding on the Company and not subject to revocation.
This submission does not preclude that claims for provisional measures in summary proceedings may be brought before a competent Dutch court.
11        Enforcement of New York judgments  In the absence of an applicable treaty between United States and the Netherlands, a judgement rendered by any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (the “New York Court”) will not be enforced by Dutch courts.
In order to obtain a judgement which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court.
If and to the extent that the Dutch court finds that the jurisdiction of
F-2
the New York Court has been based on grounds which are internationally acceptable and that proper legal procedures have been observed, the Dutch court would, in principle, give binding effect to the final judgement of the New York Court unless such judgement contravenes principles of Dutch public policy.
12        Taxation  The statements contained in the Supplemental Prospectus under the caption “Taxation - Dutch Taxation” are in all material respects a true and accurate summary of the material Dutch tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling Notes applicable to the holders of Notes described therein.
