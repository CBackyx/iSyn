“Acquired Debt” means, with respect to any specified Person:
(1)         Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged with or into or became a Subsidiary of such specified Person, whether or not such Indebtedness is incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such other Person merging with or into, or becoming, a Subsidiary of, such specified Person; and

(1)         the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, taken as a whole, than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company;
(3)         the Company delivers to the Trustee, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $5.0 million, a favorable written opinion from a nationally recognized investment banking, appraisal or accounting firm (A) as to the fairness of the transaction to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries from a financial point of view; or (B) stating that the terms of such transaction are, taken as a whole, no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary.
The definition of “Affiliate Transaction” above is subject to the exceptions in Section 4.15(b).

In case any Note that has matured or is about to mature or has been surrendered for required repurchase or is about to be converted in accordance with Article 11 shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, in its sole discretion, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note), as the case may be, if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such Authenticating Agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and, if applicable, any Paying Agent or Conversion Agent evidence of their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.
Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 by virtue of the fact that any Note is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
To the extent permitted by law, all Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement, payment, conversion or repurchase of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement, payment, conversion or repurchase of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Except for any Notes surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, or as otherwise expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture, no Notes shall be authenticated in exchange for any Notes surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation.

Section 2.10                            Authenticating Agent.

Said Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of
37
the Trustee to authenticate Notes issued upon exchange, transfer or partial redemption, repurchase or conversion thereof, and Notes so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder.
All references in this Indenture to the authentication of Notes by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent.
Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall be a corporation that has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust business, and that is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities.
Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto.

(b)                                 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05, the Global Note may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.05, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
(c)                                  The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act.
The Company initially appoints DTC to act as Depositary with respect to each Global Note.
Initially, each Global Note shall be issued to the Depositary, registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the nominee of the Depositary, and deposited with the Trustee as custodian for Cede & Co. None of the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Conversion Agent shall have any responsibility or liability for any act or omission of DTC.
Physical Notes issued in exchange for all or a part of the Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, or, in the case of clause (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph,
38
the relevant beneficial owner, shall instruct the Trustee.
At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for Physical Notes, converted, canceled, repurchased or transferred to a transferee who receives Physical Notes therefor or any Physical Note is exchanged or transferred for part of such Global Note, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Note Custodian, be appropriately reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Note Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction or increase.
None of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Note or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

The Company may, to the extent permitted by law, and directly or indirectly (regardless of whether such Notes are surrendered to the Company), repurchase Notes in the open market or otherwise, whether by the Company or its Subsidiaries or through a privately negotiated transaction or public tender or exchange offer or through counterparties to private agreements, including by cash-settled swaps or other derivatives, in each case, without prior notice to the Holders.
The Company shall cause any Notes so repurchased (other than Notes repurchased pursuant to cash-settled swaps or other derivatives) to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation in accordance with Section 2.08 and such Notes shall no longer be considered outstanding under this Indenture upon their repurchase.
Section 2.13                            CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Notes may use “CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use “CUSIP” numbers in all notices issued to Holders as a convenience to such Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or on such notice and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes.

43
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock or preferred interests; provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and the Subsidiary Guarantors may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue preferred stock or preferred interests, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, for the most recently completed four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock or preferred interests are issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 3.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock or preferred interests had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, Section 4.10(a) above will not prohibit the incurrence of any Permitted Debt.
(c)                                  For the purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.10, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (22) of the definition of “Permitted Debt,” or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section 4.10(a), the Company will be permitted to classify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification), in any manner that complies with this Section 4.10; provided that (x) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement on the Issue Date will be treated as incurred under clause (1) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and (y) all Indebtedness represented by Existing Notes and outstanding on the Issue Date will be treated as incurred under clause (2) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and, in each case, may not be reclassified.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of any Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred or first committed, in the case of revolving Indebtedness.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.10, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this Section 4.10 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
(e)                                  The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be (i) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount; (ii) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and (iii) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of (a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination and (b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
This Section 4.10 shall cease to apply upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition thereof or at such time as 25% or less of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding.
Section 4.11                            Asset Sales.
(a)                                 The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(i)                                     the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets subject to such Asset Sale; and
44
(ii)                                  at least 75% of the consideration paid to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Asset Sale is, or will be when paid (in the case of milestones, royalties and other deferred payment obligations), in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.
For the purposes of clause (ii) above, the amount (without duplication) of any Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that is expressly assumed by the transferee in such Asset Sale and with respect to which the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is unconditionally released by the holder of such Indebtedness shall be deemed cash.
(b)                                 The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, effect any Product Intellectual Property Sale or Exclusive Product License to any Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor.
(c)                                  The Net Proceeds (or any portion thereof) from Asset Sales may be applied by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (A) within 90 days of receipt thereof, to repay, prepay, repurchase, redeem, legally defease or otherwise retire the Credit Facilities or any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary secured by a Lien on assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (excluding, in any such case, any Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) (for purposes of this Section 4.11, the “Senior Obligations”) or (B) within 360 days of receipt thereof, if the Asset Sale is not a Product Intellectual Property Sale and solely with respect to the percentage of the Net Proceeds set forth in the “Company Retention” column in the table below, to reinvest in Additional Assets or R&D Expenditures (including by means of an Investment in Additional Assets or R&D Expenditures by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Proceeds received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary), and in the case of either clause (A) or (B), to the extent not so applied shall constitute “Excess Proceeds.”

Any remaining proceeds thereafter
(d)                                 Pending application of Net Proceeds pursuant to this Section 4.11, such Net Proceeds shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Senior Obligations, be invested in Cash Equivalents or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness.
If the Asset Sale is not a Product Intellectual Property Sale and solely with respect to the percentage of the Net Proceeds set forth in the “Company Retention” column in the table above, any Net Proceeds that are not segregated from the general funds of the Company for investment in identified Additional Assets or R&D Expenditures in respect of a project that shall have been commenced, and/or for which binding contractual commitments have been entered into, prior to the end of such 360-day period shall constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided, however, that the amount of any Net Proceeds that ceases to be so segregated as contemplated above and any unapplied Net Proceeds that is segregated in respect of a project that is abandoned or completed shall also constitute “Excess Proceeds” at the time any such Net Proceeds ceases to be so segregated or at the time the relevant project is so abandoned or completed, as applicable; provided further, however, that the amount of any Net Proceeds that continues to be segregated for investment and that is not actually reinvested within 18 months from the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds shall also constitute “Excess Proceeds.”
To the extent that any portion of the amount of Net Proceeds remains after compliance with the preceding sentence and provided that all Holders of
45
Nothing shall prevent the Company from conducting an Asset Sales Prepayment Offer earlier than as set forth in this paragraph.
(g)                                  In connection with any Asset Sales Prepayment Offer pursuant to this Section 4.11, the Company will, if required:
(i)                                     comply with the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act that may then be applicable;
(iii)                               otherwise comply in all material respects with all federal and state securities laws in connection with any offer by the Company to repurchase the Notes;
in each case, so as to permit the rights and obligations under this Section to be exercised in the time and in the manner specified herein.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue thereof.

(a)                                 The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly effect a Restricted Payment, unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:
(i)                                     no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur after giving effect to such Restricted Payment;
(ii)                                  the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth under Section 4.10; and
(iii)                               such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date, is less than the sum, without duplication, of:
46
(3)                     to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is sold or otherwise liquidated or repaid, the amount of the cash return of capital with respect to such Restricted Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any), to the extent that such return was not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for such period; plus
(4)                     without duplication of amounts that increase the amount available pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments” and this Section 4.12, cash dividends or distributions received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for such period; plus
(5)                     to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor, the lesser of the initial amount of such Restricted Investment and the Fair Market Value of the Investment of the Company in such entity at the time it becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor.
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein, Section 4.12(a) will not prohibit:

Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes.
Section 4.17                            Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Company will be Restricted Subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors will be able, at any time after the Issue Date, to designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided, that immediately before and after such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Restricted Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments permitted under Section 4.12.
That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.12.
If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.10, the Company will be in Default of Section 4.10.
The Board of Directors may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and the creation, incurrence, assumption or otherwise causing to exist any Lien of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.10, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the relevant four-quarter period; (2) such Lien is permitted; and (3) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
52
Section 4.18                            Limitation on Issuance of Capital Stock.

This Section 4.18 shall cease to apply upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition thereof or at such time as 25% or less of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding.

Section 6.02                            Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j) with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all Notes shall become and shall automatically be immediately due and payable.
The immediately preceding paragraph, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Notes and the principal of any and all Notes that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and unpaid interest to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, and on such principal at the rate borne by the Notes at such time) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.06, and if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any and all existing Events of Default under this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on Notes that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 6.09, then and in every such case (except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all Defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Notes and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
55
no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any Default or Event of Default resulting from (i) the nonpayment of the principal (including the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, or accrued and unpaid interest on, any Notes, (ii) a failure to repurchase any Notes when required or (iii) a failure to pay or deliver, as the case may be, the consideration due upon conversion of the Notes.

If the Company so elects, such Additional Interest shall be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated interest payable on the Notes.
The provisions of this Section 6.03 shall not affect the rights of Holders of Notes in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default.
In the event the Company does not elect to pay the Additional Interest following an Event of Default relating to the Reporting Obligations in accordance with this Section 6.03 or the Company elected to make such payment but does not pay the Additional Interest when due, the Notes shall be immediately subject to acceleration under Section 6.02.
Section 6.04                            Payments of Notes on Default; Suits Therefor.
If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or
56
decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes, wherever situated.
In the event there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes under Title 11 of the United States Code, or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Company or such other obligor, the property of the Company or such other obligor, or in the event of any other judicial proceedings relative to the Company or such other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.04, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, in respect of the Notes, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such other actions as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on the Notes, its or their creditors, or its or their property, and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 8.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, Custodian or similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Holders to make such payments to the Trustee, as administrative expenses, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements, including agents and counsel fees, and including any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 8.06, incurred by it up to the date of such distribution.
To the extent that such payment of reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, monies, securities and other property that the Holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting such Holder or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes.
In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of the Notes parties to any such proceedings.
In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of any waiver pursuant to Section 6.09 or any rescission and annulment pursuant to Section 6.02 or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Holders and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Holders and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

Section 6.05                            Application of Monies Collected by Trustee.
Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 6 with respect to the Notes shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon presentation of the several Notes, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:
Second, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on, and any cash due upon conversion of, the Notes in default in the order of the date due of the payments of such interest and cash due upon conversion, as the case may be, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon such overdue payments at the rate borne by the Notes at such time, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto;
Section 6.06                            Proceedings by Holders.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal (including, if applicable, the Redemption Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price) or interest when due, or the right to receive payment or delivery of the consideration due upon conversion, no Holder of any Note shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator, Custodian or other similar official, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
(c)                                  such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee such security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, in its reasonable judgment, against any loss, liability, claim or expense to be incurred therein or thereby;
(d)                                 the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of such security or indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and
(e)                                  no direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding within such 60-day period pursuant to Section 6.10, it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Note with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee that no one or more Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by availing of any provision of
58
this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holder, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders (except as otherwise provided herein).
For the protection and enforcement of this Section 6.06, each and every Holder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and any provision of any Note, each Holder shall have the right to receive payment or delivery, as the case may be, of (x) the principal (including the Redemption Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, (y) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, and (z) the consideration due upon conversion of, such Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for in such Note or in this Indenture, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment or delivery on or after the applicable due date, as the case may be.
Section 6.07                            Proceedings by Trustees.
In case of an Event of Default, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as are necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Section 6.08                            Remedies Cumulative and Continuing.
Except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article 6 to the Trustee or to the Holders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any of the Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.07, every power and remedy given by this Article 6 or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders.
Section 6.09                            Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by Majority of Holders.
The Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes; provided, however, that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.
The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.04 may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, or the principal (including any Redemption Price and any Fundamental Change Repurchase Price) of, the Notes when due that has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, (ii) a failure by the Company to pay or deliver, as the case may be, the consideration due upon conversion of the Notes or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article 10 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected.
Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Whenever any Default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 6.09, said Default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Note by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section 6.11 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.04, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on any Note (including, but not limited to, the Redemption Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) on or after the due date expressed or provided for in such Note or to any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note, or receive the consideration due upon conversion, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11.

(a)                                 The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes and after the curing of all Events of Default with respect to the Notes that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform with respect to the Notes such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.
In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes has occurred (that has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to the Notes such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs.
(b)                                 No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i)                                     prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to the Notes that may have occurred:
(A)                   the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall with respect to the Notes be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to the Notes except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(B)                   in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may with respect to the Notes conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the
62
Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
(ii)                                  the Trustee shall not be liable to any Holder or to any other Person for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(iii)                               the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Indenture with respect to the Notes;
(iv)                              none of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Indenture or adequate indemnity and security against such risk is not reasonably assured to it;

(vi)                              The permissive right of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty of the Trustee; and

Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:
(a)                                 The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, security or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
(b)                                 Any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution or an instrument signed in the name of the Company by any authorized Officer of the Company (unless other evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed herein);
(c)                                  The Trustee may consult with counsel and the opinion or written advice of such counsel or, if requested, any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

63
(e)                                  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;
(f)                                   The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, security, or other papers or documents or inquire as to the performance by the Company of one of its covenants under this Indenture, unless requested in writing so to do by the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes affected thereby (determined as provided in Section 9.04); provided, however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require security or indemnity reasonably acceptable to the Trustee against such costs, expenses or liabilities as a condition to so proceeding.
The reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand;
(g)                                  The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
(h)                                 [Reserved];
(i)                                     In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action; and
(j)                                    The Trustee agrees to accept and act upon instructions or directions pursuant to this Indenture sent by unsecured e-mail, facsimile transmission or other similar unsecured electronic methods; provided, however, that such instructions or directions shall be signed by an authorized representative of the party providing such instructions or directions.
The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction.
The party providing electronic instructions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk or interception and misuse by third parties.
(k)                                 The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder and under the Notes, and each agent, custodian or other Person employed to act under this Indenture.
(m)                             Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer’s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both.
The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.
64
(n)                                 Any rights in favor of the Trustee that may be discretionary in nature shall not be construed as duties of the Trustee.

(a)                                 The recitals contained herein and in the Notes shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for any rating on the Notes or any action or omission of any rating agency.

The Trustee or any Paying Agent or Note Registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent or Note Registrar.
Section 8.05                            Moneys Held in Trust.
Subject to the provisions of Section 14.06, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder except such as it may agree in writing with the Company to pay thereon.
Section 8.06                            Compensation and Reimbursement.
The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.
The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it.
Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee’s agents and counsel.
(b)                                 The Company shall indemnify each of the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder against any loss, liability or expense (including the cost of defending itself and including the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee’s agents and counsel) incurred by it except as set forth in Section 8.06(c) in the exercise or performance of its powers, rights or duties under this Indenture as Trustee or agent (whether asserted against the Company or any other person).
The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity.
The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense.
The Trustee may have one separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.
The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
This indemnification shall apply to Officers, directors, employees, shareholders and agents of the Trustee.
(c)                                  The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee or by any Officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent of the Trustee through their negligence or willful misconduct (as determined in a final non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction).
(d)                                 To ensure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all funds or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of or
65
interest on particular Notes.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or (j), the expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for services in connection therewith are to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
Section 8.07                            Reliance on Officer’s Certificate.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it reasonably necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.
Section 8.08                            Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.

Section 8.09                            Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

If such corporation or other Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation or other Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.
The Company may not, nor may any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, serve as Trustee.
In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign promptly in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 8.10.
Section 8.10                            Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the sending of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Notes, or any Holder of such Notes who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee.
Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
(b)                                 In case at any time any one of the following shall occur:
66
(i)                                     the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 8.08 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months; or
(iii)                               the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or commence a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or consented to, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
(c)                                  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to such Notes by so notifying the Trustee and the Company and may appoint a successor Trustee for such Notes with the consent of the Company.
(d)                                 Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Notes pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 8.11.
(e)                                  Any successor trustee appointed pursuant to this Section may be appointed with respect to the Notes, and at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Notes.
Section 8.11                            Acceptance of Appointment By Successor.
67
that no Trustee shall be responsible for any act or failure to act on the part of any other Trustee hereunder; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, such retiring Trustee shall with respect to the Notes to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates have no further responsibility for the exercise of rights and powers or for the performance of the duties and obligations vested in the Trustee under this Indenture, and each such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Notes to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee, to the extent contemplated by such supplemental indenture, the property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Notes to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates.
(c)                                  Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8.11, as the case may be.
(d)                                 No successor trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
Section 8.12                            Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, including the administration of the trust created by this Indenture, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 8.08 and eligible under the provisions of Section 8.09, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
In case any Notes shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes.
ARTICLE 9
CONCERNING THE HOLDERS
Section 9.01                            Evidence of Action by Holders.
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the Holders of such majority or specified percentage of those Notes have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such Holders of Notes in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing.
If the Company shall solicit from the Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so.
If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given
68
before or after the record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Notes have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Notes shall be computed as of the record date; provided, however, that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Holders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
Section 9.02                            Proof of Execution by Holders.
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Holder (such proof will not require notarization) or his or her agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Notes shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
(a)                                 The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
(b)                                 The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register of such Notes or by a certificate of the Note Registrar thereof.
The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.
Section 9.03                            Who May be Deemed Owners.
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Note Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Note shall be registered upon the books of the Note Registrar as the absolute owner of such Note (whether or not such Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Note Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Note and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
Section 9.04                            Certain Notes Owned by Company Disregarded.
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, the Notes that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Notes or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Notes shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Notes that the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
The Notes so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s right so to act with respect to such Notes and that the pledgee is not a Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor.
In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee.
Section 9.05                            Actions Binding on Future Holders.
Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Note, and of any Note
69
issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Note.
Any action taken by the Holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Notes specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Notes.
ARTICLE 10

(f)                                   to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;
(g)                                  in connection with any Share Exchange Event, to provide that the Notes are convertible into Reference Property, subject to the provisions of Section 11.02, and make such related changes to the terms of the Notes to the extent expressly required by Section 11.09;
(h)                                 to increase the Conversion Rate as provided in this Indenture;

(j)                                    to provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee, Note Registrar, Paying Agent or Conversion Agent or facilitate the administration of the trusts under this Indenture by more than one Trustee or Paying Agent;
(k)                                 to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository, including DTC, in a manner that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder; or
(l)                                     conform the provisions of this Indenture to the “Description of Notes” section in the preliminary offering memorandum, as supplemented by the related pricing term sheet, as evidenced in an Officer’s Certificate.
Upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to, but may in its discretion, enter into any supplemental indenture that affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
70
Any supplemented indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section 10.01 may be executed by the Company and the Trustee without the consent of the Holders of any of the Notes at the time outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provision of Section 10.02.
Section 10.02                     Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.
With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article 9) of the Holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (determined in accordance with Article 9 and including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a repurchase of, or tender or exchange offer for, Notes), the Company, when authorized by the resolutions of the Board of Directors and the Trustee, at the Company’s expense, may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders; provided, however, that, without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected, no such supplemental indenture shall:
(a)                                 reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment or waiver;
(b)                                 reduce the rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;
(c)                                  reduce the principal of or extend the Maturity Date of any Note;
(d)                                 except as required by this Indenture, make any change that adversely affects the conversion rights of any Notes;
(e)                                  reduce the Redemption Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of any Note or amend or modify, in any manner adverse to the Holders, the Company’s obligation to make such payments, whether through an amendment or waiver of provisions in the covenants, definitions or otherwise;
(f)                                   make any Note payable in a currency, or at a place of payment, other than that stated in the Note;
(g)                                  change the ranking of the Notes;
(h)                                 make any change in this Article 10 or in the waiver provisions in Section 6.02 or Section 6.09, in each case, that requires each Holder’s consent; or
(i)                                     other than in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, eliminate any Subsidiary Guarantee of the Notes.
Upon the written request of the Company, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Holders as aforesaid and subject to Section 10.05, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
Holders do not need under this Section 10.02  to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture.
It shall be sufficient if such Holders approve the substance thereof.
However, the failure to give such notice to all the Holders, or any defect in the notice, will not impair or affect the validity of the supplemental indenture.
Section 10.03                     Effect of Supplemental Indentures.
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article 10, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company and the
71
Holders shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
Section 10.04                     Notation on Notes.
Notes authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article 10 may, at the Company’s expense, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture.
If the Company or the Trustee shall so determine, new Notes so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may, at the Company’s expense, be prepared and executed by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee (or an Authenticating Agent duly appointed by the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.10) and delivered in exchange for the Notes then outstanding, upon surrender of such Notes then outstanding.
Section 10.05                     Evidence of Compliance of Supplemental Indenture to Be Furnished to Trustee.
In addition to the documents required by Section 17.08, the Trustee shall receive an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant hereto complies with the requirements of this Article 10, is permitted or authorized by this Indenture and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.
ARTICLE 11
CONVERSION OF NOTES
Section 11.01                                        Conversion Privilege.
Section 11.02                                        Conversion Procedure; Settlement Upon Conversion.
72
In addition, a Holder may be required to provide a certification to the Company as to whether the Person or Persons receiving shares of Common Stock upon conversion is, or would, as a result of such conversion, become the beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of any Beneficial Ownership Limits then applicable to such Person or Persons.
The exercise of such conversion rights shall be irrevocable.
If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
(c)                                  A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the “Conversion Date”) that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in Section 11.02(b).
(e)                                  If a Holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issuance of any shares of Common Stock upon conversion, unless the tax is due because the Holder requests such shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than such Holder’s name, in which case such Holder shall pay that tax.
(f)                                   Except as provided in Section 11.06, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article 11.
(g)                                  Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Note Custodian (if other than the Trustee) at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby.
(h)                                 Upon conversion, a Holder shall not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest, if any, except as set forth below.
The Company’s settlement of the full Conversion Obligation shall be deemed to satisfy in full its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the relevant Conversion Date.
As a result, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the relevant Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited.
73
(i)                                     The Person in whose name the shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon conversion shall become the holder of record of such shares as of the close of business on the relevant Conversion Date.
Section 11.03                                        Special Settlement in Connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or Redemption Period.
(a)                                 If a Note is to be converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or during a Redemption Period, then the Company will settle such conversion based on a Conversion Rate that reflects the Additional Shares added thereto pursuant to the provisions described in Section 11.05.
However, in order to comply with Section 713 of the NYSE American LLC Company Guide that limit the number of shares of Common Stock the Company may deliver upon conversion of the Notes unless the Company first obtains the approval of its stockholders (the “Requisite Stockholder Approval”) in accordance with the rules of the NYSE American, the Company may be required to partially cash settle conversions made in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or during a Redemption Period.
Accordingly, if the Company has not obtained the Requisite Stockholder Approval as of the effective date of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or a Redemption Notice Date, as applicable, then the Company will settle the conversion of a Note made in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change or during a Redemption Period as follows:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary described above, if the consideration for the Common Stock in any Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change is comprised entirely of cash, then the Company will settle the conversion of any Note following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change by delivering, on or before the second Business Day after the Conversion
74
Section 11.04                                        Limits Upon Issuance of Shares of Common Stock Upon Conversion.
(a)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Person will be entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon conversion of the Notes to the extent, but only to the extent, that such receipt would cause such Person to become, directly or indirectly, a Beneficial Owner of more than 9.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding at such time (such restriction, the “General Beneficial Ownership Limit”).
For purposes of this Section 11.04 only, a Person shall be deemed the “Beneficial Owner” of and shall be deemed to beneficially own any shares of Common Stock that such Person or any of such person’s Affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) or associates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is deemed to beneficially own, together with any shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by any other persons whose beneficial ownership would be aggregated with such Person for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
Subject to the following proviso, for purposes of the this Section 11.04 only, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as in effect on the Issue Date; provided that the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Person and its Affiliates and associates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership would be aggregated with such Person for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of any of the Company’s securities or rights to acquire the Common Stock, whether or not such securities or rights are currently exercisable or convertible or are exercisable or convertible only after the passage of time (including the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes in respect of which the beneficial ownership determination is being made), but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, unconverted portion of any Notes beneficially owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates or associates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership would be aggregated with such Person for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any of the Company’s other securities subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates or associates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership would be aggregated with such Person for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Beneficial Owner” as used in this Section 11.04 shall not include (i) with respect to any Global Note, the nominee of the Depositary or any Person having an account with the Depositary or its nominee or (ii) with respect to any certificated Note, the Holder of such certificated Note unless, in each case, such nominee, account holder or Holder shall also be a Beneficial Owner of such Note.
(c)                                  Any purported delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes shall be void and have no effect to the extent, but only to the extent, that such delivery would result in any Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limits applicable to such Person.
75
(d)                                 Unless the Company has waived the General Beneficial Ownership Limit as set forth in Section 11.04(f) and there is no Holder Beneficial Ownership Limit applicable to a Holder, when such Holder tenders Notes for conversion, that Holder must provide a certification to the Company as to whether the Person (or Persons) receiving shares of Common Stock upon conversion is, or would, as a result of such conversion, become the beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of any beneficial ownership limit then applicable to such Person (or Persons).
(e)                                  If any delivery of shares of Common Stock otherwise owed to any Person (or persons) upon conversion of the Notes is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of the applicable Beneficial Ownership Limits, the Company’s obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and, such Holder may either:
Upon delivery of such notice, the provisions under Section 11.02 shall apply to the shares of Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to such notice.
(f)                                   The Company may, at their option with the approval of the Board of Directors and subject to the applicable listing standards of NYSE American, waive the General Beneficial Ownership Limit (as to a particular Person or as to all persons).
Any such waiver of the General Beneficial Ownership Limit would not effect a waiver of any Holder Beneficial Ownership Limit.
Section 11.05                                        Increased Conversion Rate Applicable to Certain Notes Surrendered in Connection with Make-Whole Fundamental Changes or Redemption Period.
A conversion of Notes shall be deemed for these purposes to be “in connection with” such Make-Whole Fundamental Change if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during the period from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change up to, and including, the Business Day immediately prior to the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (or, in the case of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that would have been a Fundamental Change but for the proviso in clause (b) of the definition thereof, the 35th Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change) (such period, the “Make-Whole Fundamental Change Period”).
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company elects to redeem less than all of the outstanding Notes, then Holders of the Notes not called for Redemption will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate for such Notes as described in this Section on account of the Redemption.
76
Common Stock, including Additional Shares, in accordance with Section 11.02 but subject to the provisions under Section 11.03; provided, however, that if the consideration received by holders of the Common Stock in exchange for such Common Stock in any Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change is composed entirely of cash, for any conversion of Notes following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Conversion Obligation shall be calculated based solely on the Stock Price for the transaction and shall be deemed to be an amount of cash per $1,000 principal amount of converted Notes equal to the Conversion Rate (including any increase to reflect the Additional Shares), multiplied by such Stock Price.
Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the five consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the relevant Effective Date or the Redemption Notice Date, as the case may be.
In the event that a conversion during a Redemption Period would also be deemed to be in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, a Holder of the Notes to be converted will be entitled to a single increase to the Conversion Rate with respect to the first to occur of the applicable Redemption Notice Date or the Effective Date of the applicable Make-Whole Fundamental Change, and the later event will be seemed not to have occurred for purposes of this Section 11.05.
The Company shall make appropriate adjustments to the Stock Price, in its good faith determination, to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date, Effective Date or expiration date of the event occurs during such five consecutive Trading Day period.
(d)                                 The Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table in Section 11.05(e) shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is otherwise adjusted.
The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
The amounts by which the Conversion Rate shall be increased as set forth in the table in Section 11.05(e) shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 11.06.

(i)                                     if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table above or the Effective Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be, is between two Effective Dates or Redemption Notice Dates, as applicable, in the table above, the amount by which the Conversion Rate shall be increased shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the amount of the Conversion Rate increase set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the earlier and later Effective Dates or Redemption Notice Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
Section 11.06                                        Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company if any of the following events occurs, except that the Company shall not make any adjustments to the Conversion Rate if Holders participate (other than in the case of (x) a share split or share combination or (y) a tender or exchange offer), at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the Notes, in any of the transactions described in this Section 11.06, without having to convert their Notes as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, multiplied by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder.
(a)                                 If the Company exclusively issues shares of the Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of the Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Any adjustment made under this Section 11.06(a) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the Effective Date for such share split or share combination, as applicable.
If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this 78 Section 11.06(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
Any increase made under this Section 11.06(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution.
To the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the distribution of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
If such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed or if such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not occurred.
For the purpose of this Section 11.06(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Company in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(c)                                  If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its Indebtedness, other assets or property of the Company or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (i) dividends, distributions or issuances as to which an 79 adjustment was effected or pursuant to Section 11.06(a) or Section 11.06(b), (ii) except as otherwise provided below, rights issued pursuant to any stockholder rights plan of the Company then in effect, (iii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which the provisions set forth in Section 11.06(d) shall apply, (iv) any dividends or distributions of Reference Property issued in exchange for the Common Stock pursuant to Section 11.09, and (v) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 11.06(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of Indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities, the “Distributed Property”), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Any increase made under the portion of this Section 11.06(c) above shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution.
If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
In the case of any distribution of rights, options or warrants, to the extent such rights options or warrants expire unexercised, the applicable Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted to the applicable Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase made for the distribution of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants.
If the Company determines the “FMV” (as defined above) of any distribution for purposes of this Section 11.06(c) by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing “SP0.” With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11.06(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange (a “Spin-Off”), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
The increase to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall occur at the close of business on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period; provided that in respect of any conversion of Notes, if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during the Valuation Period, the references to “10” in the preceding paragraph shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off and such Conversion Date in determining the Conversion Rate.
If any dividend or distribution that constitutes a Spin-Off is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay or make such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or announced.
For purposes of this Section 11.06(c) (and subject in all respects to Section 11.13), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of the Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company’s Capital Stock, including shares of Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (“Trigger Event”): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 11.06(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11.06(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 11.06(c).
In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11.06(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall no longer apply or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
For purposes of Section 11.06(a), Section 11.06(b) and this Section 11.06(c), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11.06(c) is applicable also includes one or both of: (A)                   a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 11.06(a) is applicable (the “Clause A Distribution”); or 81 (B)                   a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 11.06(b) is applicable (the “Clause B Distribution”), then, in either case, (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 11.06(c) is applicable (the “Clause C Distribution”) and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11.06(c) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 11.06(a) and Section 11.06(b) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Company (I) the “Record Date” of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Record Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be “outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date or immediately after the open of business on such Effective Date, as applicable” within the meaning of Section 11.06(a) or “outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date” within the meaning of Section 11.06(b).
(d)                                 If the Company pays or makes any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the shares of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Any increase to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to this Section 11.06(d) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.
If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
