(a)                                 Subject to this Section 11.02, Section 11.05(b) and Section 11.09(a), upon conversion of any Note, the Company shall satisfy its Conversion Obligation by delivering to the converting Holder, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, together with a cash payment, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional share of Common Stock in accordance with Section 11.02(j) and, if applicable, a cash payment as described under Section 11.03, on the second Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date.
(b)                                 Subject to Section 11.02(e), before any Holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert a Note as set forth above, such Holder shall (i) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 11.02(h) and (ii) in the case of a Physical Note, the Holder thereof shall (1) complete, manually sign and deliver an irrevocable notice (or a facsimile, PDF or other electronic transmission thereof) to the Conversion Agent as set forth in the Form of Notice of Conversion (a “Notice of Conversion”) at the office of the Conversion Agent and state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (2) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and
The Trustee (and if different, the Conversion Agent) shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 11 on the Conversion Date for such conversion.
No Holder may surrender Notes for conversion if such Holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of such Notes and has not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 12.02.
The Company shall issue or cause to be issued, and deliver (if applicable) to the Conversion Agent or to such Holder, or such Holder’s nominee or nominees, the full number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled, in book-entry format through the Depositary, in satisfaction of the Company’s Conversion Obligation.
(d)                                 In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall deliver a Company Order, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Note so surrendered a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note, without payment of any service charge by the converting Holder but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax or similar governmental charge required by law or that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such conversion being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such conversion.
The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing shares of the Common Stock being issued in a name other than such Holder’s name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that is due by such Holder in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the open of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of interest payable on the Notes so converted on the corresponding Interest Payment Date (regardless of whether the Holder was the holder of record on the corresponding Regular Record Date); provided that no such payment shall be required (1) for conversions following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the corresponding Interest Payment Date, in respect of Notes converted; (3) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the corresponding Interest Payment Date, in respect of Notes converted; or (4) to the extent of any overdue interest, if any overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.
Upon a conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes surrendered for conversion; provided that (a) the converting Holder shall have the right to receive the Conversion Obligation due upon conversion and (b) in the case of a conversion between a Regular Record Date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Holder of record as of the close of business on such Regular Record Date shall have the right to receive the full amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date, in accordance with clause (h) above.
The Company shall notify Holders, in the Make-Whole Fundamental Change Company Notice or Notice of Redemption, as applicable, whether the Company has obtained the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
(b)                                 In addition, a Holder at its option may elect a beneficial ownership limit as to such Holder (but not as to any other Holder) that is less than or equal to the general beneficial ownership limit then applicable to the Holders in general upon written notice delivered to the Company prior to the issuance of the Notes or, if thereafter, at least 61 days prior to the date of effectiveness of such lower beneficial ownership limit, specifying the percentage of shares of Common Stock for the beneficial ownership limit that shall apply to such Holder (such beneficial ownership limit, a “Holder Beneficial Ownership Limit” and together with the general beneficial ownership limit, the “Beneficial Ownership Limits”).
Written notices sent by Holders electing a Holder Beneficial Ownership Limit pursuant to this Section 11.04(b) received prior to the Issue Date and the issuance of the Notes are listed on Schedule A to this Indenture.
(i)                                     request the return of the Notes surrendered by such Holder for conversion, after which the Company shall deliver such Notes to such Holder within two trading days after receipt of such request; or
(ii)                                  certify to the Company that the Person(or persons) receiving shares of Common Stock upon conversion is not, and would not, as a result of such conversion, become the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of the applicable Beneficial Ownership Limits, after which the Company shall deliver any such shares of Common Stock withheld on account of such applicable Beneficial Ownership Limits by the later of (i) the date such shares were otherwise due to such Person(or persons) and (ii) two trading days after receipt of such certification; provided, however, until such time as the affected Holder gives such notice, no Person shall be deemed to be the stockholder of record with respect to the shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon conversion in excess of any applicable Beneficial Ownership Limit.
In the event that the Company exercises its right to waive the General Beneficial Ownership Limit to all Persons, the Company or, at the Company’s written request and expense, the Trustee, shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each Holder 61 days prior to the effective waiver date an irrevocable notice stating that as of an effective date specified therein, the Company waives any restrictions that limit a Holder from converting its Notes in the event that such Holder is, or would, as a result of a conversion of Notes, become, a restricted converting Holder.
(b)                                 Upon surrender of Notes for conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or during a Redemption Period, the Company shall satisfy the related Conversion Obligation by delivering shares of
The Company shall notify the Trustee, the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) and Holders (a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change Company Notice”), in accordance with Section 17.04, of the Effective Date of any Make-Whole Fundamental Change no later than five Business Days after such Effective Date.
