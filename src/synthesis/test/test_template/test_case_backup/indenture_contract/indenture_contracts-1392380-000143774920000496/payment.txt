Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, except as provided in Sections 7.01(e) and (f), nothing in this Indenture or in the Purchase Agreement shall prohibit or restrict a Permitted Holder from exercising its right to (x) convert the Principal Amount of any Notes, or any portion of such Principal Amount, into shares of Common Stock, at the then Applicable Conversion Price, or (y) upon a Fundamental Change, require the Company to purchase any or all of such Permitted Holder’s Notes, on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, at the Fundamental Change Purchase Price, even if such repurchase would result in such Permitted Holder holding less than the aggregate minimum percentage ownership of the aggregate Principal Amount outstanding under the Notes required under the Purchase Agreement.
(i)     Promptly following the date (the “Free Trade Date”) that is one year after the Issue Date of any Option Notes, the Company shall effect an exchange of every beneficial interest in each Global Note bearing the Restricted Notes Legend for beneficial interests in Global Notes that do not bear any Restricted Notes Legend.

If a Holder accepts such redemption offer, subject to Section 3.14(e) hereof, the Credit Parties shall pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of such Holders, such Holder’s Pro Rata Share of the aggregate redemption price offered to Holders, together with the corresponding Mandatory Redemption Make-Whole Payment, within one (1) Business Day after the thirty (30) day period after such Holder receives the offer from the Company or the Trustee, as applicable, and each such redemption shall be accompanied by a written notice to the Trustee specifying the provision pursuant to which the redemption is being made and the amount of principal, interest and Mandatory Redemption Make-Whole Payment being paid.

The Alternate Conversion Make-Whole Payment will be an amount equal to 14% of the Principal Amount of the Notes converted into shares of Common Stock on the Alternate Conversion Date on which such payment is due.
The Company may settle the Alternate Conversion Make-Whole Payment in cash or in shares of Common Stock, at the Company's election, subject to the limitations described in Section 7.01(e) and Section 7.01(f); provided, however, that if by the Close of Business on the fourth Trading Day prior to an Alternate Conversion Date the Company has not notified its election to the Holder in writing, the Alternate Conversion Make-Whole Payment must be settled in cash; and provided, further, that the Company may only pay the Alternate Conversion Make-Whole Payment in shares of Common Stock if the Last Reported Sale Price on the Trading Day prior to the Alternate Conversion Date was higher than the Applicable Conversion Price as of such date.

Section 6.06     Refunds
(b)     Upon conversion, Holders shall not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest unless such conversion occurs between a Regular Record Date and the Interest Payment Date to which it relates and the converting Holder was the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date.
(c)     If Notes are converted after the Close of Business on a Regular Record Date for the payment of interest, Holders of such Notes at the Close of Business on such Regular Record Date will receive the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date (including any outstanding PIK Interest) notwithstanding the conversion.
(d)     The Company shall not issue fractional shares upon conversion of Notes (and on payment of any Make-Whole Payment in shares of Common Stock, as applicable).
If any fractional share would be issuable upon the conversion of any Notes (and on payment of any Make-Whole Payment in shares of Common Stock, as applicable), the Company shall make payment of an amount in cash for the current market value of the fractional shares.
The current market value of a fractional share shall be determined (calculated to the nearest 1/1000th of a share) by multiplying the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the relevant Conversion Date by such fractional share and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent.
(e)     By delivery to the Holder of the full number of shares of Common Stock, together with any applicable Make-Whole Payment in cash or in shares of Common Stock, as applicable, and any cash payment for fractional shares, issuable upon conversion, the Company will be deemed to satisfy in full its obligation to pay the Principal Amount of the Notes so converted, the applicable Make-Whole Payment, as applicable, and all accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Conversion Date.
(f)     Each Holder who elects to convert any of its Notes at the Holder’s option will receive a payment (the “Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment”) for the Notes being converted.
The Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment will be an amount equal to the product of (x) the Principal Amount of the Notes surrendered for conversion and (y) the Applicable Percentage as in effect on the date on which the Holder shall have delivered the Conversion Notice.
The Company may settle the Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment in cash or in shares of Common Stock, at the Company's election, subject to the limitations described in Section 7.01(e) and Section 7.01(f); provided, however, that if the Last Reported Sale Price on the Conversion Date was higher than the Applicable Conversion Price as of such date, the Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment must be settled in shares of Common Stock, which for purposes of such payment shall be valued at the Applicable Conversion Price, and in all events the Common Stock so delivered by the Company must be freely tradeable without restrictions under Rule 144.
If the Company elects to pay the Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment in shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver to each Holder of converted Notes a number of shares of Common Stock at settlement equal to (i) the amount of the Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment owed to such Holder and being paid in shares of Common Stock divided by (ii) the Applicable Conversion Price.
If the Company elects or, due to the limitations set forth herein, is obligated to pay the Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment in cash, the Company shall, on the second Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date, deposit with the Paying Agent a sum (in funds which are immediately available on the due date for such payment) sufficient to pay such Voluntary Conversion Make-Whole Payment, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
(b)     If the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of shares of Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days after the date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of such distribution, the Applicable Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants divided by the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of the distribution of such rights, options or warrants.
In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of shares of Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase or exercise conversion rights for, shares of Common Stock at a purchase price less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such distribution, and in determining the aggregate exercise or purchase price payable for such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable upon exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.
the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; and
provided that if “FMV” as set forth above is equal to or greater than “SP0” as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing increase, adequate provision will be made so that each Holder of a Note shall receive on the date on which the Distributed Property is distributed to holders of the Common Stock, for the Principal Amount of the Notes, the amount and kind of Distributed Property that such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Applicable Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such distribution; provided further that if the Company’s Board of Directors determines “FMV” for purposes of the foregoing increase by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for purposes of determining “SP0” as set forth above.
the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of shares of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined for purposes of the definition of “Last Reported Sale Price” as if such Capital Stock or similar equity interest were Common Stock) over the first ten consecutive Trading Day period after, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off (the “Valuation Period”); and
the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the Valuation Period.
(A)     a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 7.04(a) is applicable (the “Clause A Distribution”); or
(d)     If any cash dividend or distribution is paid or made to all or substantially all holders of shares of Common Stock, the Applicable Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; and
the amount in cash per share the Company distributes to holders of shares of Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “C” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, for the Principal Amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.
(e)     If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock (excluding odd lots of shares of Common Stock), to the extent that the cash and fair market value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the “Expiration Date”) on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer, the Applicable Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Expiration Date (prior to giving effect to the purchase of all shares of Common Stock accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender offer or exchange offer);
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Date (after giving effect to the purchase of all shares of Common Stock accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender offer or exchange offer); and
the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date.
(i)     Adjustments to the Applicable Conversion Rate under this Article 7 shall be calculated to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share of Common Stock.
(d)     Each Holder whose Notes are converted into shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Contractual Amortization Conversion Agreement will receive on each Contractual Conversion Date a payment (the “Contractual Conversion Make-Whole Payment”) for the Notes being converted.
The Contractual Conversion Make-Whole Payment will be an amount equal to the product of (x) the Principal Amount of the Notes surrendered for conversion and (y) the Applicable Percentage as in effect on the Contractual Conversion Date.
The Company may settle the Contractual Conversion Make-Whole Payment in cash or in shares of Common Stock, at the Company's election, subject to the limitations described in Section 7.01(e) and Section 7.01(f); provided, however, that if by the Close of Business on the fourth Trading Day prior to a Contractual Conversion Date the Company has not notified its election to the Holder in writing, the Contractual Conversion Make-Whole Payment must be settled in cash; and provided, further, that the Company may only pay the Contractual Conversion Make-Whole Payment in shares of Common Stock if the Last Reported Sale Price on the Trading Day prior to the Contractual Conversion Date was higher than the Applicable Conversion Price as of such date.
If the Company elects to pay the Contractual Conversion Make-Whole Payment in shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver to each Holder of converted Notes a number of shares of Common Stock at settlement equal to (i) the amount of the Contractual Conversion Make-Whole Payment owed to such Holder and being paid in shares of Common Stock divided by (ii) the Applicable Conversion Price as of the Contractual Conversion Date on which payment is due.
If a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes, then each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder’s option to require the Company to purchase any or all of such Holder’s Notes, on a date specified by the Company that is no earlier than the 20th and not later than the 35th calendar day following the date of the Fundamental Change Company Notice, subject to extension to comply with Applicable Law (the “Fundamental Change Purchase Date”), at a purchase price (the “Fundamental Change Purchase Price”) in cash equal to (i) 100% of the Principal Amount thereof, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Purchase Date (provided, however, that if the Fundamental Change Purchase Date occurs after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest Payment Date to which it relates, the Company will pay accrued and unpaid interest to the Holder of record on such Regular Record Date) or, in the case of a Default by the Company in the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price with respect to such Notes, the day on which such Default is no longer continuing, plus (iii) an amount (the “Fundamental Change Make-Whole Payment”) equal to 14% of the Principal Amount specified in clause (i) above.
Purchases of Notes under this Section 8.01 shall be made, at the option of the Holder thereof upon:
(v)     the Fundamental Change Purchase Price;

The Fundamental Change Purchase Price, including the Fundamental Change Make-Whole Payment, shall be paid in cash.

If the Obligations are repaid, in whole or in part, following the incurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (whether by acceleration or otherwise and including, but not limited to, an insolvency event described in Sections 9.01(i) and Section 9.01(j)), the Issuer shall pay, together with such payment, an additional amount (the “Acceleration Make-Whole Payment”) equal to 14% of the Principal Amount so repaid and until so paid such Acceleration Make-Whole Payment will be part of the Obligations then due and payable.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, if so elected by the Requisite Holders, in addition to ordinary interest payable pursuant to Section 4.01, the Company shall pay Additional Interest on the Notes, which shall accrue at the rate of 2.0% per annum of the Principal Amount of Notes outstanding for each day during the period from and including the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to and including the date on which such Event of Default has been cured or waived or ceases to exist.
Any Additional Interest payable pursuant to this Section 9.03 will be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date following accrual in the same manner as ordinary interest is payable pursuant to Section 4.01.
The Company covenants that if a Default is made in the payment of the Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Maturity Date therefor (or upon declaration of acceleration hereunder) or in the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price and any Make-Whole Payment which is then due and payable in respect of any Note, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on such Notes, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

Notwithstanding the proviso in the foregoing sentence, (i) interest on the first Interest Payment Date after the First Issue Date will be payable only in cash, and (ii) if the Initial Holders elect to exercise the option under the Purchase Agreement to purchase any Option Notes on or after the first Interest Payment Date after the First Issue Date, interest on the second Payment Date after the First Issue Date will be payable only in cash.
PIK Interest on the Notes will be payable by increasing the Principal Amount of the Notes by an amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) (or, if necessary, pursuant to the requirements of The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, as the case, to authenticate new Global Notes executed by the Company with such increased Principal Amount of the Notes).
Following an increase in the Principal Amount of the Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, the Notes will bear interest on such increased Principal Amount from and after the date of such PIK Payment.
Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated, at the option of the Holder, to repurchase the Notes if a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to the Maturity Date at (i) 100% of the Principal Amount together, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Purchase Date (including but not limited to any outstanding accrued but not yet capitalized PIK Interest and all outstanding capitalized PIK Interest), plus (iii) the Fundamental Change Make-Whole Payment, which aggregate amount will be paid in cash.
(7)     Payment of Fundamental Change Purchase Price.
If money sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price of all Notes or portions thereof to be purchased on a Fundamental Change Purchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, such Notes will cease to be outstanding and interest will cease to accrue on such Notes (or portions thereof) immediately after the Close of Business on such Fundamental Change Purchase Date, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Fundamental Change Purchase Price, upon surrender of such Note).
No fractional shares will be issued upon any conversion, but a payment in cash will be made, as provided in the Indenture, in respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the surrender of any Notes for conversion.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form in minimum denominations of $1,000, and any PIK Notes in minimum denominations of $1.00, as provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth.
