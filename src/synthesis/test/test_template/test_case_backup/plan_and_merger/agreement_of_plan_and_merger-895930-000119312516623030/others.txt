(ii) Subject to Section 2.1(a)(i) and Section 2.3, each share of AmSurg Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and thereafter shall represent one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Amethyst (“New Amethyst Common Stock”).
(b) Effects of Merger 2 on Holdings Capital Stock.
At the Merger 2 Effective Time, by virtue of Merger 2 and without any action on the part of Holdings or New Amethyst, or any holder of any shares of Holdings Common Stock, New Amethyst Common Stock or New Amethyst Preferred Stock:(i) All shares of Holdings Common Stock that are owned by New Amethyst or any Subsidiary of New Amethyst or that are held in the treasury of Holdings immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
(ii) Subject to Section 2.1(b)(i), Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.3, each share of Holdings Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive that number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of New Amethyst Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Merger 2 Consideration”).

(iii) All such shares of Holdings Common Stock shall be converted into shares of New Amethyst Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) and shall be cancelled and cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist and, as of the Merger 2 Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Holdings Common Stock (a “Holdings Certificate”) or shares of Holdings Common Stock held in book entry form (“Holdings Book-Entry Shares”) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.1(b), the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount, upon surrender of such Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2.
(c) Certain Adjustments.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Merger 2 Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Holdings Common Stock, AmSurg Common Stock or New Amethyst Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger 2 Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Holdings Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.
(d) Fractional Shares.
9
AmSurg, New Amethyst and Holdings acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of New Amethyst Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to New Amethyst that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of New Amethyst Common Stock in Merger 2.
Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Holdings Common Stock entitled thereto, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Holdings Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of New Amethyst Common Stock (the “Common Shares Trust”).
The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Holdings Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying (x) the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Holdings Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Holdings Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (the “Fractional Shares Cash Amount”).
(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Holdings Common Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of New Amethyst Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of shares of Holdings Common Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.2.2.2 Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry.
(a) Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the shareholders of AmSurg and the stockholders of Holdings, AmSurg and Holdings shall mutually appoint a nationally recognized financial institution to act as exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”) and AmSurg, New Amethyst and Holdings shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent providing for, among other things and in each case in accordance with this Article 2, the delivery, following the Merger 2 Effective Time, to the holders of Holdings Common Stock of the shares of New Amethyst Common Stock into which such holders’ shares were converted pursuant to Merger 2 and the Fractional Shares Cash Amount, if applicable.
10
The Holdings Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
(c) All shares of New Amethyst Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Holdings Common Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of any rights pertaining to such shares of Holdings Common Stock.
(d) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the New Amethyst Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder.
If payment of the Merger 2 Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Holdings Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent to payment that the Holdings Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger 2 Consideration, as applicable, to a Person other than the registered holder of the Holdings Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of Holdings that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Delivery of the Merger 2 Consideration with respect to Holdings Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Holdings Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Merger 2 Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount as provided in this Agreement.
AmSurg.
From and after the Merger 1 Effective Time, the holders of AmSurg Common Certificates and AmSurg Common Book-Entry Shares representing shares of AmSurg Common Stock and the holders of AmSurg Preferred Certificates and AmSurg Preferred Book-Entry Shares representing shares of AmSurg Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
(h) Holdings Transfer Books.
From and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, the holders of Holdings Certificates and Holdings Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Holdings Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, after the Merger 2 Effective Time, Holdings Certificates representing shares of Holdings Common Stock are presented to New Amethyst for any reason, such Holdings Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for a number of shares of New Amethyst Common Stock equal to the number of such shares of Holdings Common Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount as provided in this Agreement.
If, prior to six years after the Closing Date (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Holdings Certificates or Holdings Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in this Section 2.2 to receive the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the Merger 2 Consideration and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount to which such holder would otherwise be entitled in respect of such Holdings Certificates or Holdings Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of New Amethyst, free and clear of all claims or 13
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Holdings, AmSurg, New Amethyst or the Exchange Agent, or any Representative or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any holder of a Holdings Certificate or Holdings Book-Entry Share for the Merger 2 Consideration or, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) Any failure of Holdings’s or AmSurg’s respective Subsidiaries or its and their respective Representatives to fully comply with this Section 5.4 (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were directly subject to this Section 5.4) shall be deemed a breach of this Section 5.4 by Holdings or AmSurg, as applicable.

5.8 Public Announcements.
Each party agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of Holdings and AmSurg (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the extent such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.
Holdings and AmSurg agree that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release in the form heretofore agreed by the parties.
In addition, subject to the right of the Holdings Board to make a Holdings Adverse Recommendation Change or the AmSurg Board to make an AmSurg Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5.4, Holdings and AmSurg agree to cause their respective directors and officers to refrain from taking any position in any public statement that is (a) contrary to the positions previously taken by AmSurg and Holdings with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Mergers or (b) reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions.5.9 Indemnification.
(a) From and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, New Amethyst shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under (i) applicable Law, (ii) Holdings’ and AmSurg’s organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) any Contract of Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and officer of Holdings, AmSurg and any of their respective Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an “Indemnitee” and, collectively, the “Indemnitees”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at, prior to or after the Merger 2 Effective Time, including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.
(b) New Amethyst agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) now existing in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in charter, bylaws or other organizational documents shall survive the Mergers and shall 95
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
For a period of no less than six (6) years from the Merger 2 Effective Time, New Amethyst shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational documents of Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Merger 1 Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.
(c) For six (6) years from and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, New Amethyst shall maintain for the benefit of the Indemnitees, a D&O insurance policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of Holdings, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that New Amethyst shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by AmSurg prior to the date of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that, in the event that the requisite coverage is not available for an annual premium less than or equal to 250% of such last annual premium, New Amethyst shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for 250% of such last annual premium).
The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid “tail” policies have been obtained prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Merger 2 Effective Time, including in respect of the Transactions.
(d) In the event that New Amethyst or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, New Amethyst shall cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.
(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under Holdings’s, AmSurg’s or any of their respective Subsidiaries’ organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of Holdings, AmSurg or any of their 96
respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
The obligations of New Amethyst under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Holdings, AmSurg or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.5.10 Stock Exchange Listing.

5.13 Tax Matters.
(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither AmSurg, New Amethyst or Holdings shall take, or omit to take, any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to, prevent or impede either of the Mergers from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Both prior to and following the Merger 2 Effective Time, AmSurg, New Amethyst and Holdings shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to take or cause to be taken any action necessary for each of the Mergers to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the “Intended Tax Treatment”), including (i) reasonably refraining from any action that such party knows, or is reasonably expected to know, is reasonably likely to prevent the Intended Tax Treatment and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d), and any tax opinions required to be filed with the SEC in connection with the filing of the Form S-4, including by executing customary letters of representation.

(c) New Amethyst shall cause to be maintained during the Protection Period those Holdings Benefit Plans and AmSurg Benefit Plans providing severance pay and termination benefits that are set forth on Section 5.14(c) of the AmSurg Disclosure Schedule such that, in the event of the termination of employment of any Legacy Holdings Employee or any Legacy AmSurg Employee during the Protection Period, such individual shall be entitled to severance pay and termination benefits set forth under such disclosed arrangement applicable to such termination (if any), and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such Holdings Benefit Plan or AmSurg Benefit Plan.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Legacy Holdings Employee and Legacy AmSurg Employee who ceases to be eligible to participate in an Old Plan shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any corresponding New Plan to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable and intended to replace the benefits under any such Old Plan, and (B) for purposes of any New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits, New Amethyst shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Legacy Holdings Employee and Legacy AmSurg Employee and his or her covered dependents, except to the extent such conditions would not have been waived under the applicable Old Plan, and New Amethyst shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Legacy Holdings Employee or Legacy AmSurg Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Legacy Holdings Employee’s or Legacy AmSurg Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring New Amethyst or any of its Subsidiaries to continue (or resume) the employment of any specific person following the Closing Date.
In addition, no provision of this Section 5.14 shall be construed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee, officer, current or former director or consultant of AmSurg or Holdings or any of their Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary of such employee, officer, director or consultant under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement sponsored by any such Person, nor is any provision of this Section 5.14 intended to constitute an amendment to any such employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement.

Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.Section 10.

(c) If more than one share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock, or, if applicable, other common stock or full ADRs, issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion.
Conversion Rate Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates.
(a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:(i) If the Corporation issues Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a subdivision or combination (including, without limitation, a stock split or a reverse stock split) of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
If any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination of the type described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay or make such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination and (b) the date the dividend or distribution was to be paid or the date the subdivision or combination was to have been effective, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to issue such rights, options or warrants and (b) the date such rights, options or warrants were to have been issued, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been announced.For purposes of this Section 11(a)(ii), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance, and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Corporation receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
(iii) If the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, excluding:(1) any dividend, distribution or issuance as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) or Section 11(a)(ii);(2) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv) below;(3) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 11(a)(iii) apply; and(4) any dividends or distributions in connection with a Reorganization Event that is included in Exchange Property under Section 11(e), 23
where,CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date;SP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; andFMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock.If the Board of Directors determines the “FMV” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iii)) of any dividend or other distribution for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) by referring to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “FMV” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iii)) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iii)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, in respect of each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of Common Stock, the amount and kind of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution.Any increase made under the portion of this Section 11(a)(iii) above shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution.
If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay the dividend or other distribution and (b) the date such dividend or distribution was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the dividend or other distribution had not been declared.
24
If the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (a “Spin-Off’) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or a reasonably comparable non-U.S. equivalent, then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall instead be increased based on the following formula:
of the Corporation’s capital stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (“Trigger Event”):(i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock;(ii) are not exercisable; and(iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) (and no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this Section 11(a)(iii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made under this Section 11(a)(iii).
(C) In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding clause (B)) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this clause (iii) was made:(1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or repurchase (x) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv), equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase; and(2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.For purposes of Section 11(a)(i), Section 11(a)(ii) and this Section 11(a)(iii), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable includes one or both of:(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 11(a)(i)is applicable (the “Clause A Distribution”); or(B) an issuance of rights, options or warrants to which Section 11(a)(ii) is applicable (the “Clause B Distribution”), 26
then:(1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable (the “Clause C Distribution”) and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11(a)(iii) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made; and(2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Corporation (I) the “Record Date” of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Record Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be “outstanding immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date or immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such effective date” within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) or “outstanding immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date” within the meaning of Section 11(a)(ii).
27
If such distribution is not so paid, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend and (b) the date such dividend was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rates that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
(vi) If the Corporation has in effect a stockholder rights plan while any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, Holders shall receive, upon a conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in addition to Common Stock, rights under the Corporation’s stockholder rights agreement unless, prior to such conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock.
If the rights provided for in the stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights agreement so that Holders would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of the Common Stock, if any, that the Corporation is required to deliver upon conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) above, subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.
A distribution of rights pursuant to a stockholder rights plan will not trigger an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 11(a)(iii) above.
(b) Adjustment for Tax Reasons.
The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 11, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of the Corporation’s shares (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; provided that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
If any adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate is treated as a distribution to any Non-U.S. Holder which is subject to withholding tax, the Corporation (or Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf of the Corporation) may set off any withholding tax that is required to be collected with respect to such deemed distribution against cash payments and other distributions otherwise deliverable to such Non-U.S.
Holder.
(c) Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price, Applicable Market Value and Five-Day Average VWAP.

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 11(a), no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made if Holders participate in the transaction that would otherwise require an adjustment (other than in the case of a share split or share combination), at the same time, upon the same terms and otherwise on the same basis as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as if such Holders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate as of the Record Date for such transaction, multiplied by the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock held by such Holders.

(e) Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of the Common Stock.

Reorganization Event by a Person, then the Exchange Property receivable upon such Reorganization Event shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock that affirmatively make an election with respect to the kind and amount of Exchange Property so receivable (or of all such holders if none makes an election).
The Conversion Rate then in effect shall be applied on the applicable Conversion Date to the amount of such Exchange Property received per share of Common Stock in the Reorganization Event (a “Unit of Exchange Property”), as determined in accordance with this Section 11(e).
For the purpose of determining which clause of the definition of Conversion Rate shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to postponement as described in Section 5(a)) and for the purpose of calculating the Conversion Rate if clause (ii) of the definition thereof is applicable, the value of a Unit of Exchange Property shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that if a Unit of Exchange Property includes common stock or American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, the value of such common stock or ADRs shall be the Applicable Market Value determined with regard to a share of such common stock or a single ADR, as the case may be (or for the purpose of determining the Stock Price on a Fundamental Change Conversion Date, the value of such common stock or ADRs shall be the Five-Day Average VWAP determined with regard to a share of such common stock or a single ADR, as the case may be).
For the purpose of paying accrued and unpaid dividends in Units of Exchange Property in accordance with Section 4, the value of a Unit of Exchange Property shall equal 97% of the value determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.The above provisions of this Section 11(e) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 11(a)-(d) shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or of any successor) received by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.The amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation providing that the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be convertible into Exchange Property shall also provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments that are as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments described under this Section 11.

If any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination of the type described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay or make such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination and (b) the date the dividend or distribution was to be paid or the date the subdivision or combination was to have been effective, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to issue such rights, options or warrants and (b) the date such rights, options or warrants were to have been issued, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been announced.For purposes of this Section 11(a)(ii), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance, and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Corporation receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
(iii) If the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, excluding:(1) any dividend, distribution or issuance as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) or Section 11(a)(ii);(2) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv) below;(3) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 11(a)(iii) apply; and(4) any dividends or distributions in connection with a Reorganization Event that is included in Exchange Property under Section 11(e), 23
where,CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date;SP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; andFMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock.If the Board of Directors determines the “FMV” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iii)) of any dividend or other distribution for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) by referring to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “FMV” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iii)) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iii)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, in respect of each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of Common Stock, the amount and kind of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution.Any increase made under the portion of this Section 11(a)(iii) above shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution.
If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay the dividend or other distribution and (b) the date such dividend or distribution was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the dividend or other distribution had not been declared.
24
If the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (a “Spin-Off’) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or a reasonably comparable non-U.S. equivalent, then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall instead be increased based on the following formula:
of the Corporation’s capital stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (“Trigger Event”):(i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock;(ii) are not exercisable; and(iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) (and no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this Section 11(a)(iii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made under this Section 11(a)(iii).
(C) In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding clause (B)) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this clause (iii) was made:(1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or repurchase (x) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv), equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase; and(2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.For purposes of Section 11(a)(i), Section 11(a)(ii) and this Section 11(a)(iii), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable includes one or both of:(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 11(a)(i)is applicable (the “Clause A Distribution”); or(B) an issuance of rights, options or warrants to which Section 11(a)(ii) is applicable (the “Clause B Distribution”), 26
then:(1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable (the “Clause C Distribution”) and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11(a)(iii) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made; and(2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Corporation (I) the “Record Date” of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Record Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be “outstanding immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date or immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such effective date” within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) or “outstanding immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date” within the meaning of Section 11(a)(ii).
27
If such distribution is not so paid, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend and (b) the date such dividend was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rates that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
(vi) If the Corporation has in effect a stockholder rights plan while any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, Holders shall receive, upon a conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in addition to Common Stock, rights under the Corporation’s stockholder rights agreement unless, prior to such conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock.
If the rights provided for in the stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights agreement so that Holders would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of the Common Stock, if any, that the Corporation is required to deliver upon conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, the Corporation’s assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) above, subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.
A distribution of rights pursuant to a stockholder rights plan will not trigger an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 11(a)(iii) above.
(b) Adjustment for Tax Reasons.
The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 11, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of the Corporation’s shares (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; provided that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
If any adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate is treated as a distribution to any Non-U.S. Holder which is subject to withholding tax, the Corporation (or Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf of the Corporation) may set off any withholding tax that is required to be collected with respect to such deemed distribution against cash payments and other distributions otherwise deliverable to such Non-U.S.
Holder.
(c) Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price, Applicable Market Value and Five-Day Average VWAP.
(i) All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/10,000th of a share.If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this Section 11, an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made (x) to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of Conversion Rate shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to 29
The Corporation shall make appropriate adjustments to the VWAP per share of Common Stock used to calculate the Applicable Market Value or the Five-Day Average VWAP, as the case may be, to account for any adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates that became effective during the period in which the Applicable Market Value or the Five-Day Average VWAP, as the case may be, is being calculated.
(ii) Notwithstanding Section 11(a), no adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made if Holders participate in the transaction that would otherwise require an adjustment (other than in the case of a share split or share combination), at the same time, upon the same terms and otherwise on the same basis as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as if such Holders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate as of the Record Date for such transaction, multiplied by the number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock held by such Holders.
(iii) The Fixed Conversion Rates shall not be adjusted except as provided herein.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall not be adjusted for:(A) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation’s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in the Common Stock under any plan;(B) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan, employee agreement or arrangement or program of the Corporation or any Subsidiaries of the Corporation;(C) the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the Issue Date;(D) a change solely in the par value of the Common Stock;(E) stock repurchases that are not tender offers, including structured or derivative transactions;(F) as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of fewer than 100 shares of Common Stock;(G) a third-party tender or exchange offer; or(H) the payment of dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, whether in cash or in shares of Common Stock.
(iv) The Corporation shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity and its action in so doing, as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors, shall be final and conclusive unless clearly inconsistent with the intent hereof.
30
(d) Notice of Adjustment.
(e) Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of the Common Stock.
In the event of:(A) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than changes only in par value or resulting from a subdivision or combination);(B) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person or any statutory exchange or binding share exchange; or(C) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries;in each case as a result of which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for, or converted into, other securities, property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (any such event, a “Reorganization Event”), then, at the effective time of such Reorganization Event, each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the kind and amount of such other securities, property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that holders of the Common Stock received in such Reorganization Event (the “Exchange Property”), and, at the effective time of such Reorganization Event, the Corporation shall amend its Certificate of Incorporation to provide for such change in the convertibility of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock; provided that if the kind and amount of Exchange Property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such 31
Reorganization Event by a Person, then the Exchange Property receivable upon such Reorganization Event shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock that affirmatively make an election with respect to the kind and amount of Exchange Property so receivable (or of all such holders if none makes an election).
The Conversion Rate then in effect shall be applied on the applicable Conversion Date to the amount of such Exchange Property received per share of Common Stock in the Reorganization Event (a “Unit of Exchange Property”), as determined in accordance with this Section 11(e).
For the purpose of determining which clause of the definition of Conversion Rate shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date (subject to postponement as described in Section 5(a)) and for the purpose of calculating the Conversion Rate if clause (ii) of the definition thereof is applicable, the value of a Unit of Exchange Property shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that if a Unit of Exchange Property includes common stock or American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, the value of such common stock or ADRs shall be the Applicable Market Value determined with regard to a share of such common stock or a single ADR, as the case may be (or for the purpose of determining the Stock Price on a Fundamental Change Conversion Date, the value of such common stock or ADRs shall be the Five-Day Average VWAP determined with regard to a share of such common stock or a single ADR, as the case may be).
For the purpose of paying accrued and unpaid dividends in Units of Exchange Property in accordance with Section 4, the value of a Unit of Exchange Property shall equal 97% of the value determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.The above provisions of this Section 11(e) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 11(a)-(d) shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or of any successor) received by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.The amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation providing that the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be convertible into Exchange Property shall also provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments that are as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments described under this Section 11.
(f) For purposes of this Section 11, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.Section 12.
Liquidation Rights.

(c) Residual Distributions.
(d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation.
For purposes of this Section 12, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.Section 13.
No Sinking Fund.
The Series A-1 Preferred Stock will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions.Section 14.
Shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock that are duly converted in accordance herewith or repurchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance; provided that any such cancelled shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock may be reissued only as shares of any series of Preferred Stock other than Series A-1 Preferred Stock.Section 15.
Voting Rights.
(a) General.
Holders shall not have any voting rights in respect of their shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.
Except as provided herein with respect to voting rights allocated pro rata with other classes or series of Parity Stock based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series, Holders will be entitled to one vote for each such share on any matter on which Holders are entitled to vote, including any action by written consent.
33
(b) Preferred Directors.
If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal from office as described above, the remaining Preferred Director may choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.At any time after the right of Holders to elect Preferred Directors has become vested and is continuing but a meeting of the Corporation’s stockholders to elect such Preferred Directors has not yet been held, or if a vacancy shall exist in the office of any such Preferred Director that has not been filled by the remaining Preferred Director, the Board of Directors may, but shall not be required to, call a special meeting of Holders and the holders of any one or more classes or series of outstanding Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable at the time, for the purpose of electing the Preferred Directors that such Holders and holders are entitled to elect; provided that in the event the Board of Directors does not call such special meeting, such election will be held at the next annual meeting.
At any such meeting held for the purpose of electing such Preferred Director or Preferred Directors, as the case may be, (whether at an annual meeting or special meeting), the presence in person or by proxy of the Holders and holders of shares representing at least a majority of the voting power of 34
the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock having similar voting rights shall be required to constitute a quorum of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock having similar voting rights.
The affirmative vote of Holders and the holders of any Parity Stock having similar voting rights constituting a majority of the voting power of such shares present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to elect any such Preferred Director.
(c) Voting Rights as to Particular Matters.
So long as any shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and all other Parity Stock having similar voting rights that are exercisable at the time, voting together as a single class (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), given in person or by proxy, either by vote at any meeting called for such purpose, or by written consent in lieu of such meeting, shall be necessary for effecting or validating:(i) Authorization of Senior Stock.
Any amendment or alteration of the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize or create or increase the authorized amount of, or any issuance of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of, any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to Series A-1 Preferred Stock with respect to either or both the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (“Senior Stock”);(ii) Amendment of Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation (including, unless no vote on such merger or consolidation is required by Section 15(c)(iii), any amendment, alteration or repeal by means of a merger, consolidation or otherwise) so as to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock; or(iii) Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations.
Any consummation of a binding share exchange, a reclassification involving the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x) the Series A-1 Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) the Series A-1 Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such new preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of Series A-1 Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole;provided, however, that for all purposes of this Section 15(c), the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, whether pursuant to pre-emptive or similar rights or otherwise, of any series of Preferred Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or 35
exercisable for any other series of Preferred Stock (including the Series A-1 Preferred Stock), ranking equally with and/or junior to Series A-1 Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers, and shall not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the Holders.
(d) Procedures for Voting and Consents.
The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of Holders (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws, applicable law and the rules of any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series A-1 Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time.Section 16.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are issued in book-entry form through DTC or any similar facility, such notices may be given to the Holders in any manner permitted by such facility.Section 18.
No Pre-emptive Rights; No Redemption Right.
No share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted.

Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.
Every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by certificates shall be entitled to have, and the Board may in its sole discretion permit a holder of uncertificated shares to receive upon request, a certificate signed by the appropriate officers of the Corporation, certifying the number and class of shares owned by such holder.
Such certificate shall be in such form as the Board may determine, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws.Section 5.02.

If a transfer of shares is made for collateral security, and not absolutely, this fact shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented to the Corporation for transfer or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so.Section 5.06.
The Board may appoint one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates representing shares to bear the signature of any such transfer agents or registrars.ARTICLE VIINDEMNIFICATIONSection 6.01.

The Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by the DGCL and other applicable law, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a “proceeding”) by reason of the fact that (x) such person is or was serving or has agreed to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation, or (y) such person, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, manager or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or (z) such person is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or manager of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by such person in such capacity, and who satisfies the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or other applicable law:(i) in a proceeding other than a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person or on such person’s behalf in connection with such proceeding and any appeal therefrom, or(ii) in a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person or on such person’s behalf in connection with the defense or settlement of such proceeding and any appeal therefrom.
(b) Indemnification in Respect of Successful Defense.
To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding referred to in Section 6.01(a) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
19
(c) Indemnification in Respect of Proceedings Instituted by Indemnitee.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Section 6.01(a) does not require the Corporation to indemnify a present or former director or officer of the Corporation in respect of a proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by such person on his or her own behalf, unless such proceeding (or part thereof) has been authorized by the Board or the indemnification requested is pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.03 of these By-laws.Section 6.02.
Advance of Expenses.
The Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by law advance all expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by a present or former director or officer in defending any proceeding prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon written request of such person and delivery of an undertaking by such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Article VI or otherwise.
The Corporation may authorize any counsel for the Corporation to represent (subject to applicable conflict of interest considerations) such present or former director or officer in any proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such proceeding.Section 6.03.
Procedure for Indemnification.
Any indemnification under Section 6.01 of these By-laws or any advance of expenses under Section 6.02 of these By-laws shall be made only against a written request therefor (together with supporting documentation) submitted by or on behalf of the person seeking indemnification or advance.
Indemnification may be sought by a person under Section 6.01 of these By-laws in respect of a proceeding only to the extent that both the expenses and liabilities for which indemnification is sought and all portions of the proceeding relevant to the determination of whether the person has satisfied any appropriate standard of conduct have become final.
A person seeking indemnification or advance of expenses may seek to enforce such person’s rights to indemnification or advance of expenses (as the case may be) in the Delaware Court of Chancery to the extent all or any portion of a requested indemnification has not been granted within 90 days of, or to the extent all or any portion of a requested advance of expenses has not been granted within 20 days of, the submission of such request.
All expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by such person in connection with successfully establishing such person’s right to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article, in whole or in part, shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.Section 6.04.
Burden of Proof.
(a) In any proceeding brought to enforce the right of a person to receive indemnification to which such person is entitled under Section 6.01 of these By-laws, the Corporation has the burden of demonstrating that the standard of conduct applicable under the DGCL or other applicable law was not met.
A prior determination by the Corporation (including its Board or any Committee thereof, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct does not itself constitute evidence that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(b) In any proceeding brought to enforce a claim for advances to which a person is entitled under Section 6.02 of these By-laws, the person seeking an advance need only show that he or she has satisfied the requirements expressly set forth in Section 6.02 of these By-laws.
20
Section 6.05.
Contract Right; Non-Exclusivity; Survival.
(a) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI shall be deemed to be separate contract rights between the Corporation and each director and officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the DGCL are in effect, and no repeal or modification of any of these provisions or any relevant provisions of the DGCL shall adversely affect any right or obligation of such director or officer existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.
Such “contract rights” may not be modified retroactively as to any present or former director or officer without the consent of such director or officer.
(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other indemnification or advancement of expenses to which a present or former director or officer of the Corporation seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled by any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
(c) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VI to any present or former director or officer of the Corporation shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.Section 6.06.

Employees and Agents.
The Board, or any officer authorized by the Board generally or in the specific case to make indemnification decisions, may cause the Corporation to indemnify any present or former employee or agent of the Corporation in such manner and for such liabilities as the Board may determine, up to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and other applicable law.Section 6.08.
Interpretation; Severability.
Terms defined in Sections 145(h) or (i) of the DGCL have the meanings set forth in such sections when used in this Article VI.
If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director or officer of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in 21
settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.ARTICLE VIIOFFICESSection 7.01.
