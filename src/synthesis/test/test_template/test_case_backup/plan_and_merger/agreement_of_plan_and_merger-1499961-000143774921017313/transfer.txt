The filing of the Agreement of Merger shall be made on the Closing Date.
(b)         Immediately prior to the filing of the Agreement of Merger, a closing (the “Closing”) shall be held at such place as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VII.
At the Merger Effective Time:
(f)          as soon as practicable following the Merger, Parent will cause its current ticker symbol “NETE” to be changed to such ticker symbol as Company shall select after the date hereof upon Nasdaq’s approval of Parent’s listing application.
Promptly after the date hereof and prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company has delivered the names of its proposed Director Nominees and Officers Nominees to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Parent Board.
All accumulated Late Fees are due and payable by the Company on the 5th day of each calendar month commencing on February 5, 2021 and on the 5th day of each month thereafter until the above-refenced filing has occurred.
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with such bank or trust company that may be designated by Parent and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent certificates representing those Parent Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 and Section 2.02(e) as of the Merger Effective Time (such certificates for Parent Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent Shares contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 and Section 2.02(e) out of the Exchange Fund.
As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was, at the Merger Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares represented by certificates (“Certificates”) as well as those not represented by a Certificate (a “Book-Entry Share”) entitled to receive Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.01 and 2.02(e):  (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in the form and substance approved by the Company in writing prior to the Closing and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal or, in the case of shares held as Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal.
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation (or evidence of ownership of such shares if held as Book-Entry Shares), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, a certificate representing that number of Parent Shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01 and 2.02(e) in respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or held as Book-Entry Shares (after taking into account all Company Shares then held by such holder) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled (or ownership thereof cancelled if such shares were issued as Book-Entry Shares).
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01 and 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) may be issued to a transferee if the transferee or transferor presents to the Exchange Agent all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid and the Certificate(s) representing such Company Shares (should such a certificate exist).

At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
(b)    The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demand for Company repurchase of Company Shares received by the Company, any withdrawal of any such demand and any correspondence or other instrument served on the Company pursuant to Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect thereto.
