SECTION 2.01    Conversion of Securities .
At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:
(a)    except for the Dissenting Shares, each share of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Company Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically, subject to Section 2.02, into the right to receive that number of shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series A Preferred Stock, Parent Series B Preferred Stock and Parent Series C Preferred Stock, as the case may be (collectively the “Parent Shares”), as set forth and further described on Schedule A hereto, the number of shares of Parent common stock to be issued to holders of Company common stock and issuable upon conversion of the Parent Series A Preferred Stock, Parent Series B Preferred Stock and Parent Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the Current Noteholder Warrants and any other warrants and/or notes issued at or prior to the Merger Effective Time by Mullen or any of its Affiliates to any Person (including, without limitation, to Acuitas and any other investor into the Company Series C Preferred Stock) and assumed or to be assumed upon or after the Merger by Parent to be known as the “Underlying Parent Common Shares”);
(d)    each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.
(e)     For purposes of this Agreement, the aggregate number of Underlying Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to the Merger plus the Escrow Shares shall constitute 85% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully-diluted and converted basis immediately after the Merger Effective Time (the Parent Pre-Merger Stockholders to own 15% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully-diluted and converted basis immediately after the Merger Effective Time).
For purposes of determining the  aggregate number of Underlying Parent Common Shares and Escrow Shares issuable pursuant to the Merger, Parent will cause its transfer agent to provide, on the day prior to the Merger Effective Time, a list of the then outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully-diluted and converted basis.
For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully-diluted and converted basis prior and/or after to the Merger Effective Time, the parties shall  include all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of outstanding warrants, options or other convertible securities of Parent outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time plus, for purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully-diluted and converted basis immediately after to the Merger Effective Time, the Underlying Parent Common Shares and the Escrow Shares.
Parent and the Company may agree that Parent may raise additional capital beyond the Net Cash Position (as defined in Section 7.03(g)).
In such event, the Company and its shareholders shall solely absorb all of the dilution from such additional capital raise beyond the Net Cash Position for purposes of allocating ownership between the Parent Pre-Merger Stockholders, on the one hand, and all other parties, on the other hand.

Except as contemplated by Section 2.02(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
(b)    Exchange Procedures.

(c)    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company Common Stock.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Merger Effective Time with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Company Common Stock until the holder shall surrender the Certificate pursuant to the letter of transmittal or, in the case of shares held as Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal.
(d)    No Further Rights in Company Common Stock.
All Parent Shares issued upon conversion of the Company Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c)) shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.
(e)     No Fractional Shares.
No certificates or scrip of Parent Shares representing fractional Company Shares will be issued; in lieu thereof, Parent shall issue one Parent Share to the holder of any Company Shares that would otherwise be entitled to such fractional Parent Shares.
(f)    Adjustments to Parent Shares.
The number Parent Shares which a holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01 and 2.02(e) and the number of Escrow Shares shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Merger Effective Time.
(g)    No Liability.
Neither of the Exchange Agent or Parent shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares or Parent Shares for any such Company Shares or Parent Shares, as applicable (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(h)    Withholding Rights.
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares or Parent Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares or Parent Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.
If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares to which the holders thereof have the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01 and 2.02(e), and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), as applicable.
SECTION 2.03    Stock Transfer Books.
From and after the Merger Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.
On or after the Merger Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the shares of the common stock of Parent to which the holders thereof have the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01 and 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).
SECTION 2.04    Dissenting Shares.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately before the Merger Effective Time that are held by a stockholder (a “Dissenting Stockholder”) that has not voted in favor of or consented in writing to the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and has complied with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code concerning the right of holders of Company Shares to require the Company to repurchase their Company Shares (“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive Parent Shares as provided in Section 2.01, but shall instead become the right to receive from Parent such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code (and at the Merger Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code).
If, prior to the Merger Effective Time, such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for Company repurchase of such Dissenting Stockholder’s Company Shares or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting Stockholder’s right to such repurchase, in any case pursuant to Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code, such Dissenting Stockholder’s Company Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Merger Effective Time into the right to receive, without interest, Parent Shares as provided in Section 2.01.
SECTION 2.05    Affiliates.

SECTION 9.04    Severability.
If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

SCHEDULE A
Initial Parent Shares
Notes issued further to the Pre-Merger Issuance are referred to herein as the “Additional Investor Notes” and warrants issued further to the Pre-Merger Issuance are referred to herein as the “Additional Noteholder Warrants.” The sum of the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon full conversion of Series C Preferred Stock issuable further to the Pre-Merger Issuance and upon full conversion of the Current Investor Notes and the Additional Investor Notes is referred to herein as the “Investor Conversion Shares” (44,732,441 shares), the sum of the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon full exercise of warrants issued further to the Pre-Merger Issuance, the Current Noteholder Warrants and sum of the Additional Noteholder Warrants is referred to herein as the “Warrant Shares” and the warrants issued further to the Pre-Merger Issuance, the Current Noteholder Warrants and the Additional Noteholder Warrants is referred to herein as the “Investor Warrants” (116,892,615 warrants).
The shares of Parent  Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants immediately after the Merger Effective Time shall represent the same percentage of shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully diluted and fully converted basis (but excluding shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding) pursuant to the Merger, in each case based on ownership of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger) as the percentage of Company Common Stock issuable upon full exercise of the Investor Warrants is of the outstanding Company Common Stock on a fully diluted and fully converted basis immediately prior to the Merger (including conversion of the Drawbridge Note, the Current Investor Notes and the Additional Investor Notes and exercise of the Investor Warrants); in connection with the foregoing, there shall be a corresponding adjustment to the conversion price of the Mullen Series C Preferred and the exercise price of the Investor Warrants.
The holders of the Company Common Stock, Company Series C Preferred Stock  and Company Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled in the aggregate to that percentage of the Post Merger Capitalization remaining after deducting (i) the percentage allocation to the Parent Pre-Merger Stockholders set forth in Section 2.01, (ii) the Series B Percentage, (iii) the Investor Warrant Percentage and (iii) that percentage of the Post Merger Capitalization represented by the Drawbridge Conversion Shares (the “Drawbridge Conversion Percentage”) - such remaining percentage being referred to as the “Remainder Percentage” -- and the shares of Parent Common Stock immediately after the Merger Effective Time represented by such Remainder Percentage, the “Remainder Shares.”  As a share of the Remainder Percentage, the holders of the Company Common Stock, Company Series C Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to those holders’ respective percentage ownership of the Company’s outstanding common stock on a fully converted basis immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, excluding the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock and the Investor Warrants.
As such, the holders of the Company Common Stock will be issued in the aggregate that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to that entitled percentage of the Remainder Shares, the holders of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock will be issued in the aggregate that number of shares of Parent Series C Preferred Stock which converts into that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to that entitled percentage of the Remainder Shares and the holders of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock will be issued in the aggregate that number of shares of Parent Series A Preferred Stock which converts into that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to that entitled percentage of the Remainder Shares.
As the holders of the Investor Warrants are exercisable for approximately 25.8% of the Company’s outstanding common stock on a fully converted and fully diluted basis immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, the holders of the Investor Warrants will be issued newly issued Parent warrants exercisable for 19,335,582 shares of Parent Common Stock.
Assuming no variance in these numbers of shares as of the Merger Effective Time, holders of the Company Common Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock would own approximately 25.8%, 17% and 57.1%, respectively, of the Remainder Percentage.
In such a case, the number of Investor Warrants would substantially increase and the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock would also increase.
In such a case, those allocations set forth in the above paragraph would materially change such that a larger percentage of the Post-Merger Sum would be allocated to the holders of Investor Warrants and a far lesser sum allocated to holders of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock.
For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate number of Underlying Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to the Merger plus the Escrow Shares shall constitute 85% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Parent common stock on a fully-diluted and converted basis immediately after the Merger Effective Time  (with the Parent Pre-Merger Stockholders to own 15% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully-diluted and converted basis immediately after the Merger Effective Time) – such 15% figure is subject to upward adjustment (with a corresponding downward adjustment in such 85% figure) pursuant to Section 2.01(e) of the Merger Agreement.
Parent and the Company may agree that Parent may raise additional capital beyond the Net Cash Position.
In such event, the Company and its shareholders shall solely absorb all of the dilution from such additional capital raise beyond the Net Cash Position for purposes of allocating ownership between the Parent Pre-Merger Stockholders, on the one hand, and all other parties, on the other hand.
SCHEDULE B
Escrow Arrangement
“Distributees” shall mean the holders of the Company’s common stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock as of the Merger Effective Time pro rata in proportion to each of their percentage holdings of the Company on a fully converted basis and fully diluted (excluding the Series B Preferred Stock, the Drawbridge Conversion Shares and Investor Warrants) as of the Closing Date as more fully set forth in Schedule A of the Merger Agreement (each of such pro rata percentage is referred to in this Schedule B as the “Common Stock Percentage”, “Series C Percentage” and Series A Percentage”, respectively).
