Dividends.
a)          Dividends in Cash or in Kind.
Subject to Corporation being authorized to pay dividends pursuant to the requirements of the Corporations Act, each Holder shall be entitled to receive, and the Corporation shall pay, cumulative preferential dividends out of funds legally available on the Stated Value represented by such Holder’s Series A Preference Shares at the rate (as a percentage of such Stated Value) of 8% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31, beginning on the first such date after the Original Issue Date, and on each Conversion Date (with respect only to Series A Preference Shares being converted) (each such date, a “Dividend Payment Date”) (if any Dividend Payment Date is not a Trading Day, the applicable payment shall be due on the next succeeding Trading Day) in cash, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, in each case as provided in the next sentence (the amount to be paid in shares of Common Stock, the “Dividend Share Amount”).
The form of dividend payments to each Holder shall be determined in the following order of priority: (i) if funds are legally available for the payment of dividends and the Corporation is authorized to pay a dividend under the Corporations Act and any of the Equity Conditions have not been met during the 20 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the applicable Dividend Payment Date (the “Dividend Notice Period”), in cash only; (ii) if funds are legally available for the payment of dividends and the Corporation is authorized to pay a dividend under the Corporations Act and all of the Equity Conditions have been met during the Dividend Notice Period, at the sole election of the Corporation, in cash or shares of Common Stock which shall be valued solely for such purpose at the average of the VWAPs for the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day that is immediately prior to the Dividend Payment Date; and (iii) if funds are not legally available for the payment of dividends and the Corporation is not authorized to pay a dividend under the Corporations Act for the payment of dividends, then such dividends shall accrue to the next Dividend Payment Date.
b)          Corporation’s Ability to Pay Dividends in Cash or Kind.
Dividends on the Series A Preference Shares shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, consisting of twelve 30 calendar-day periods, and shall accrue daily commencing on the Original Issue Date, and shall be deemed to accrue from such date whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends.
Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays dividends partially in cash and partially in shares, then such payment shall be distributed ratably among the Holders based upon the number of shares of Series A Preference Shares held by each Holder on such Dividend Payment Date.
If the Corporation is authorized to pay dividends under the Corporations Act and funds are legally available for the payment of cash dividends and the Corporation is required to or elects to pay dividends in cash then such cash dividends that are not paid within five Trading Days following a Dividend Payment Date shall continue to accrue and shall entail a late fee, which must be paid in cash, at the rate of 18% per annum or the lesser rate permitted by applicable law which shall accrue daily from the Dividend Payment Date through and including the date of actual payment in full.
Subject to the next sentence, the conversion price (the “Conversion Price”) for the Series A Preference Shares equals $[         ],2 subject to adjustment herein.
2 Will equal the Series B Effective Time Conversion Price (as defined in the Merger Agreement) divided by the Base Exchange Number (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, pay cash if the Corporation has so elected to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 6.c)vi., upon a properly noticed conversion.
As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share.
If the Corporation, at any time while the Series A Preference Shares are outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock or any other Common Stock Equivalents on shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation upon conversion of, or payment of a dividend on, the Series A Preference Shares); (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares; (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event.
If, at any time while the Series A Preference Shares are outstanding, the Corporation (x) sells or grants any option to purchase, (y) sells or grants any right to reprice, or (z) otherwise disposes of or issues, in each case other than pursuant to Section 7.c), any Post-OID Shares entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the then Conversion Price (such lower price, the “Base Conversion Price” and any such issuance, sale, or grant, a “Dilutive Issuance”), then the Conversion Price will thereby be reduced to equal the Base Conversion Price.
If holders of Post-OID Shares shall at any time (whether (x) by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or (y) due to warrants, options or rights per share that are issued in connection with the issuance of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents) be entitled to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the Conversion Price, then the Conversion Price will thereby be reduced at such time to equal such lower price.
v.           Nothing in this Section 7.b) will prevent the Corporation from redeeming all or a portion of a Holder’s shares of Series A Preference Shares in accordance with these Series A Preference Terms using all or a portion of the consideration received in connection with any issuance of Post-OID Shares.
If the Corporation, at any time while the Series A Preference Shares are outstanding, issues rights, options or warrants to all holders of Common Stock (and not to the Holders) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is lower than the VWAP on the record date referenced below, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants plus the number of shares that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered (assuming delivery to the Corporation in full of all consideration payable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants) would purchase at such VWAP.
Nothing in this Section 7.c) will prevent the Corporation from redeeming all or a portion of a Holder’s shares of Series A Preference Shares in accordance with these Series A Preference Terms using all or a portion of the consideration received in connection with any purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the rights, options, or warrants described in this Section 7.c).
The Corporation is permitted, at any time, to redeem, in accordance with this Section 9, all or some of the outstanding Series A Preference Shares for cash at an aggregate price (the “Redemption Price”) equal to (i) 1.5 multiplied by the Stated Value represented by the shares of such Series A Preference Shares so redeemed, (ii) all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared) through the date of such redemption and (iii) if applicable, all outstanding liquidated damages (the “Redemption Date”).
If the Corporation elects to redeem a portion, and not all, of the Series A Preference Shares, the Corporation shall redeem such Series A Preference Shares from all Holders pro rata in proportion to the number of Series A Preference Shares held by each such Holder relative to the number of Series A Preference Shares held by all Holders.
b)          Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, each Holder shall (in addition to all other rights it may have hereunder or under applicable law) have the right, exercisable at the sole option of such Holder, to require the Corporation to redeem all of the Series A Preference Shares then held by such Holder for a redemption price, in cash, equal to the Triggering Redemption Amount.
The Triggering Redemption Amount shall be due and payable within thirty (30) Trading Days of the date on which the notice for the payment therefor is provided by a Holder (the “Triggering Redemption Payment Date”).
If the Corporation fails to pay in full the Triggering Redemption Amount hereunder on the date such amount is due in accordance with this Section 10.b), then the Corporation will pay interest thereon at a rate equal to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, accruing daily from such date until the Triggering Redemption Amount, plus all such interest thereon, is paid in full.
In connection with the consummation of any Change of Control Transaction, the Series A Preference Shares held by each Holder immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control Transaction (a) will be hereby converted in to the right to receive, before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of other class or series of shares of the Corporation, an amount in cash equal to (i) 1.5 multiplied by the Stated Value represented by the Series A Preference Shares held by such Holder as of immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control Transaction, (ii) all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared) through the date of such Change of Control Transaction plus (iii) if applicable, all liquidated damage amounts due in respect to the Series A Preference Shares under these Series A Preference Terms, and (b) upon such conversion, such Series A Preference Shares will thereby be cancelled.
Such payment shall be made to the Holder on the effective date of the Change of Control Transaction.

The purchase price of one Ordinary Share under this Warrant shall be equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in Section 2(b).
Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased.
The exercise price per share of the Ordinary Shares under this Warrant shall be $[$0.40 divided by the Base Exchange Number (as defined in the Merger Agreement)], subject to adjustment hereunder (the “Exercise Price”).
In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing the Warrant Shares pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, Ordinary Shares to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Ordinary Shares so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of Ordinary Shares that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder.
For example, if the Holder purchases Ordinary Shares having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of Ordinary Shares with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000.
As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.
(2)   Payment shall take the form of (check applicable box): £ in lawful money of the United States; or £ [if permitted] the cancellation of such number of Warrant Shares as is necessary, in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection 2(c), to exercise this Warrant with respect to the maximum number of Warrant Shares purchasable pursuant to the cashless exercise procedure set forth in subsection 2(c).

The Series A Preference Shares initially have an aggregate stated value equal to $[                          ], which represents [             ] Series A Preference Shares with a stated value of $900.00 per share (such amount, the “Stated Value”).
Dividends.
a)         Dividends in Cash or in Kind.
Subject to Corporation being authorized to pay dividends pursuant to the requirements of the Corporations Act, each Holder shall be entitled to receive, and the Corporation shall pay, cumulative preferential dividends out of funds legally available on the Stated Value represented by such Holder’s Series A Preference Shares at the rate (as a percentage of such Stated Value) of 8% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31, beginning on the first such date after the Original Issue Date, and on each Conversion Date (with respect only to Series A Preference Shares being converted) (each such date, a “Dividend Payment Date”) (if any Dividend Payment Date is not a Trading Day, the applicable payment shall be due on the next succeeding Trading Day) in cash, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, in each case as provided in the next sentence (the amount to be paid in shares of Common Stock, the “Dividend Share Amount”).

 b)           Corporation’s Ability to Pay Dividends in Cash or Kind.
Dividends on the Series A Preference Shares shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, consisting of twelve 30 calendar-day periods, and shall accrue daily commencing on the Original Issue Date, and shall be deemed to accrue from such date whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends.

As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share.

If holders of Post-OID Shares shall at any time (whether (x) by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or (y) due to warrants, options or rights per share that are issued in connection with the issuance of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents) be entitled to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the Conversion Price, then the Conversion Price will thereby be reduced at such time to equal such lower price.
v.           Nothing in this Section 7.b) will prevent the Corporation from redeeming all or a portion of a Holder’s shares of Series A Preference Shares in accordance with these Series A Preference Terms using all or a portion of the consideration received in connection with any issuance of Post-OID Shares.
