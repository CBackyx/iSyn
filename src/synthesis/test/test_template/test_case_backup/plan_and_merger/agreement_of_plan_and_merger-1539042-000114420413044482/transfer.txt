(i)          Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock: (1) a letter of transmittal (each, a “Letter of Transmittal”), which must (A) specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to such shares will pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of such shares to the Exchange Agent and (B) be in customary form and subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time; and (2) instructions for effecting the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.
(ii)         Upon (1) in the case of Company Capital Stock represented by a Certificate, surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 3.1(b), together with the return of the applicable Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as might be required pursuant to the instructions set forth in such Letter of Transmittal or (2) in the case of Company Capital Stock represented as a Book-Entry Share, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent might reasonably request), and such other documents as might be required pursuant to the instructions set forth in the applicable Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the case might be, will thereby be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) one or more Parent Common Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Common Shares, if any, that such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (after taking into account all shares of Company Capital Stock then held by such holder), (y) one or more Parent Series A Preferred Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Preferred Shares, if any, that such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (after taking into account all shares of Company Capital Stock then held by such holder).

(v)         If there is a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, then the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock is to be issued or paid to the applicable transferee if (1) the Certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and (2) the Person requesting such exchange pays to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or establishes to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
(vi)        Until surrendered or, in the case of any Book-Entry Share, transferred, as contemplated by this Section 3.1(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Certificate that has not been properly surrendered or Book-Entry Share that has not been properly transferred with respect to the Parent Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon proper surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Book-Entry Share; except that, following the surrender of any such Certificate or transfer of any such Book-Entry Share, the Parent shall pay to such holder of Parent Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender or transfer and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or transfer payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

If any Certificate is lost, stolen, or destroyed (any such Certificate, a “Lost Certificate”) and the Person claiming such Lost Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed signs and delivers to the Exchange Agent an affidavit of that fact and, if required by the Parent, such Person posts a bond (in such reasonable amount as Parent directs) as indemnity against any claim that might be made against the Exchange Agent, the Parent, or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Lost Certificate, then the Exchange Agent will so notify the Parent, and the Parent will issue, in exchange for such Lost Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such Lost Certificate without any interest thereon.

[Signature page follows]  The Parties are signing this Agreement as of the Signing Date.
“Warrants” means, collectively, the Common Stock purchase warrants delivered to each of the Holders at the Closing.
If at any time the Corporation has the ability to legally pay dividends in cash or shares of Common Stock, then, in order to be able to pay dividends in Common Stock, the Corporation must provide the Holders with at least 20 Trading Days’ notice of its election (but only if, at the time of such dividend, the Corporation is permitted to do so pursuant to Section 3.a)) to pay a regularly scheduled dividend in shares of Common Stock (the Corporation may indicate in such notice that the election contained in such notice shall continue for later periods until revised by a subsequent notice).
e)          Dividends, Distributions and Repurchases.
The Corporation shall mail written notice of any such Liquidation, not less than 45 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each Holder.
Holders shall effect conversions by providing to the persons designated by the Corporation with the signed form of conversion notice attached hereto as Annex A (a “Notice of Conversion”).
Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Series A Preference Shares to be converted, the number of shares of Series A Preference Shares owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares of Series A Preference Shares owned subsequent to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may not be prior to the date the applicable Holder delivers by facsimile such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (such effective date, the “Conversion Date”).
To effect conversions of shares of Series A Preference Shares, a Holder shall not be required to surrender the certificate(s) representing the shares of Series A Preference Shares to the Corporation unless all of the shares of Series A Preference Shares represented thereby are so converted, in which case such Holder shall deliver the certificate representing such shares of Series A Preference Shares promptly following the Conversion Date at issue.
b)          Conversion Price.
Delivery of Certificate Upon Conversion.
Not later than five (5) Trading Days after each Conversion Date (the “Share Delivery Date”), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the converting Holder (A) a certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares which, on or after the earlier of (i) the six-month anniversary of the Original Issue Date or (ii) the Effective Date, shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those which may then be required by the Waiver Agreements) representing the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Series A Preference Shares (including, if the Corporation has given continuous notice pursuant to Section 3.b) for payment of dividends in shares of Common Stock at least 20 Trading Days prior to the date on which the Notice of Conversion is delivered to the Corporation, shares of Common Stock representing the payment of accrued dividends otherwise determined pursuant to Section 3.a) but assuming that the Dividend Notice Period is the 20 Trading Days period immediately prior to the date on which the Notice of Conversion is delivered to the Corporation and excluding for such issuance the condition that the Corporation deliver the Dividend Share Amount as to such dividend payment), and (B) a bank check in the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends as of the Conversion Date (if the Corporation has elected or is required to pay accrued dividends in cash).
On or after the earlier of (i) the six-month anniversary of the Original Issue Date or (ii) the Effective Date, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to deliver any certificate or certificates required to be delivered by the Corporation under this Section 6 electronically through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions.
Failure to Deliver Certificates.
If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such certificate or certificates are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled thereafter to elect by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before such Holder’s receipt of such certificate or certificates, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly return to the Holder any original Series A Preference Shares certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Common Stock certificates issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Conversion Notice.
Will need to confirm with the transfer agent the exact mechanics of share delivery.
If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such certificate or certificates pursuant to Section 6.c)i. on the fifth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date applicable to such conversion, then the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $2,000 of the portion of Stated Value represented by Series A Preference Shares being converted, $10 per Trading Day for each Trading Day after the fifth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date until such certificates are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion.
Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion.
In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable certificate or certificates by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 6.c)i., and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares that such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a “Buy-In”), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder’s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased by or on behalf of the Holder exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue and that were sold multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Series A Preference Shares equal to the number of shares of Series A Preference Shares submitted for conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6.c)i..

In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable certificate or certificates by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 6.c)i., and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares that such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a “Buy-In”), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder’s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased by or on behalf of the Holder exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue and that were sold multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Series A Preference Shares equal to the number of shares of Series A Preference Shares submitted for conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6.c)i.. For example, if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Series A Preference Shares with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder $1,000.
