If the Purported Transferee is determinable (other than with respect to a transaction entered into through the facilities of a national securities exchange), the Agent shall, to the extent possible, return the Prohibited Distributions to the Purported Transferor, and shall reimburse the Purported Transferee from the sales proceeds received from the Purported Transferor (or the proceeds from the disposition of any non-cash consideration) for the cost of any Excess Securities returned in accordance with Article 13.F.
