This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles which would require the application of any other State’s laws.
The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or state court located in the state of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in Section 9.4 shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.
(a) The initial press release regarding the Mergers shall be a joint press release by SuperMedia and Dex and thereafter SuperMedia and Dex each shall consult with the other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements (including conference calls with investors and analysts) with respect to the Mergers or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
No Party shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent the disclosing Party determines it is required to do so by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the NYSE or the NASDAQ, in which case such Party shall use all reasonable efforts to consult with the Other Party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

SuperMedia and Dex shall (or shall cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Other Party and its counsel on any such Merger Communication.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are hereby waived.9.11    Severability.
If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any applicable Law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank 64

Right to Indemnification.A.
Right to Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an “Indemnified Person”) who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, manager, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, company, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, non-profit entity or other enterprise, including service with respect to any employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with such Proceeding.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Article 9.C, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnified Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.B.
Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers.
judicial decision (hereinafter an “advancement of expenses”); provided, however, that, if and to the extent required by law, such payment or reimbursement of expenses in advance of the final disposition of or final judicial decision regarding the Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an “undertaking”), by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined at final disposition or by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a “Final Adjudication”) that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article 9 or otherwise.C.
Claims.
If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article 9 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after a written claim by the Indemnified Person has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.
If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.
In any action brought by the Indemnified Person to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnified Person to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the Indemnified Person has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.
Further, in any action brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking by an Indemnified Person, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a Final Adjudication that the Indemnified Person has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the Indemnified Person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) shall create a presumption that the Indemnified Person has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such an action brought by the Indemnified Person, be a defense to such action.
In any action brought by the Indemnified Person to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article 9 or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.D.
Contract Right; Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
The rights conferred by Article 9.A and Article 9.B shall be contract rights that shall fully vest at the time the Indemnified Person first assumes such Indemnified Person’s position as a director or officer of the Corporation.
The rights conferred on any person by this Article 9 shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have under the Corporation’s certificate of incorporation prior to the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.E.
Insurance.
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, trustee, manager, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, or of a partnership, company, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, non-profit entity or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under applicable law, this Article 9 or otherwise.F.
Indemnification of and Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article 9 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.
4
G. Limitations.
The Corporation shall not be liable under this Article 9 to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Indemnified Person (or pay or reimburse any expenses to any Indemnified Person) to the extent the Indemnified Person has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, other right of indemnity or agreement or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable or payable hereunder.
The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Person under this Article 9: (a) for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Corporation’s written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (b) for any judicial award if the Corporation was not given a reasonably timely opportunity to participate, at its expense, in the defense of such action, but only to the extent that the failure to be given such reasonably timely opportunity actually and materially prejudiced the Corporation’s ability to defend such action.H.
Subrogation.
In the event of payment under this Article 9, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnified Person, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents reasonably necessary to enable the Corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.I.
Amendment or Repeal; Successors.
No amendment, modification or repeal of the provisions of this Article 9, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article 9, nor to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any modification of law, shall adversely affect (or eliminate or reduce) any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any event, act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal, or adoption of any inconsistent provision or, if applicable, modification of law (regardless of when any Proceeding (or part thereof) relating to such event, act or omission arises or is first threatened, commenced or completed).
The rights conferred by this Article 9 shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person (and shall continue as to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to be a director or officer) and such person’s legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, devises and legatees.
For purposes of this Article, references to “the Corporation” shall include any constituent corporation absorbed in a merger with this Corporation which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article with respect to this Corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.10.
Amendment or Repeal of Articles 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12.
The amendment, alteration or repeal of Articles 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12 of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class; all other amendments to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.11.
Registered Holders.
The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share of stock or any warrant, right or option is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share, warrant, right or option on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice thereof, save as may be expressly provided otherwise by law.12.

After the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities.
For this purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not in accordance with the provisions of Article 13.D or Article 13.E shall also be a Prohibited Transfer.

indirect ownership interests in such Corporation Securities.
The Corporation may make such arrangements or issue such instructions to its share transfer agent as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be necessary or advisable to implement this Article 13, including, without limitation, authorizing such transfer agent to require an affidavit from a Purported Transferee regarding such Person’s actual and constructive ownership of shares and other evidence that a Transfer will not be prohibited by this Article 13 as a condition to registering any transfer.E.
(a) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Article 13.B(b)(i), the Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers (which may include the Corporation) the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more arm’s-length transactions (on the public securities market on which such Excess Securities are traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); provided, however, that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited Transfer and provided, further, that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the Agent’s discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities or otherwise would adversely affect the value of the Corporation Securities.
If the Purported Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Corporation’s demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the Corporation grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds not exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to Article 13.F if the Agent rather than the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess Securities.

The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported Transferee has previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received by it from a Purported Transferee, together, in either case, with any Prohibited Distributions, as follows: (a) first, such amounts shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its duties hereunder; (b) second, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or in the 8
event the purported Transfer of the Excess Securities was, in whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or similar Prohibited Transfer without consideration, the fair market value, (1) calculated on the basis of the closing market price for the Corporation Securities on the day before the Prohibited Transfer or, (2) if the Corporation Securities are not listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange but are traded in the over-the-counter market, calculated based upon the difference between the highest bid and lowest asked prices, as such prices are reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers through its NASDAQ system or any successor system on the day before the Prohibited Transfer or, if none, on the last preceding day for which such quotations exist, or (3) if the Corporation Securities are neither listed nor admitted to trading on any stock exchange nor traded in the over-the-counter market, then as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, which amount shall be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors); and (c) third, any remaining amounts shall be paid to one or more organizations qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of the Code (or any comparable successor provision) selected by the Board of Directors.
The Purported Transferee of Excess Securities shall have no claim, cause of action or any other recourse whatsoever against any transferor of Excess Securities.
The Purported Transferee’s sole right with respect to such shares shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to this Article 13.F.
In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to this Article 13.F inure to the benefit of the Corporation or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder.G.
Modification Of Remedies For Certain Indirect Transfers.
In the event of any Transfer which does not involve a transfer of securities of the Corporation within the meaning of Delaware law (“Securities,” and individually, a “Security”) but which would cause a 4.9-percent Shareholder to violate a restriction on Transfers provided for in this Article 13, the application of Article 13.E and Article 13.F shall be modified as described in this Article 13.G.
(a) In such case where the Prohibited Transfer is described in Article 13.B(b)(i), no such 4.9-percent Shareholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a Security, but such 4.9-percent Shareholder and/or any Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such 4.9-percent Shareholder shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to dispose of sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such 4.9-percent Shareholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of this Article 13.
Such disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of Securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall be disposed of through the Agent as provided in Article 13.E and Article 13.F, except that the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such 4.9-percent Shareholder, or to such other Person that was the direct holder of such Excess Securities, in connection with such sale shall be the fair market value of such Excess Securities at the time of the purported Transfer.
All expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of such Excess Securities shall be paid out of any amounts due such 4.9-percent Shareholder or such other Person.
(b) In such case where the Prohibited Transfer is described in Article 13.B(b)(ii), no such 4.9-percent Shareholder shall be required to acquire any interest that is not a Security, but such 4.9-percent Shareholder and/or any Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such 4.9-percent Shareholder shall be deemed to have acquired and shall be required to acquire sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be acquired in the inverse order in which they were disposed of) to cause such 4.9-percent Shareholder, following such acquisition, not to be in violation of this Article 13.
Such acquisition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of Securities that are deemed to be acquired shall be considered acquired through the Agent as provided in Article 13.E.
All expenses incurred by the Agent in acquiring such Securities shall be paid out of any amounts due such 4.9-percent Shareholder or such other Person.The purpose of this Article 13.G is to extend the restrictions in Article 13.B and Article 13.E to situations in which there is a 4.9-percent Transaction without a direct Transfer of Securities, and this Article 13.G, along with the other provisions of this Article 13, shall be interpreted to produce the same results, with differences as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of Corporation Securities.

Special Meetings.
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes, except as otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, may be called (i) by a majority of the directors in office, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, (ii) pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, or (iii) by the Secretary at the request in writing of stockholders holding shares representing at least 25% of the voting power of shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter(s) and for the purposes stated in the written request of such stockholders.
The preceding sentence shall not apply to any stockholder that has provided a request in response to a solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act (as defined herein) by way of a solicitation statement filed on Schedule 14A.
The Corporation shall not be required to hold a special meeting if, prior to such meeting, the number of unrevoked written requests constitutes less than 25% of the stockholders who were entitled to request the call of such special meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at any special meeting.
(b) Special meetings of the stockholders shall only be held at such time and at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President.

Notice of Meetings.
Notice of the place, if any, date, and time of all meetings of the stockholders, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, shall be given, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law (meaning, here and hereinafter, as required from time to time by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) or the Corporation’s certificate of incorporation as then in effect (the “Certificate of Incorporation”)).

An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent of the Corporation or any other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provisions of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the stockholder entitled to 2
notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person or entity entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.

Attendance of a stockholder of the Corporation at a meeting of such stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders of the Corporation pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders of the Corporation given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder of the Corporation to whom the notice is given.
However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
For purposes of these Bylaws, except as otherwise limited by applicable law, the term “electronic transmission” means any form of communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such recipient through an automated process.Section 5.

If a quorum is not present, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting may adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place.
When a specified item of business requires a separate vote by a class or series (if the Corporation shall then have outstanding shares of more than one class or series) voting as a class or series, the holders of a majority of the voting power of such class or series shall constitute a quorum (as to such class or series) for the transaction of such item of business.Section 7.
Adjourned Meetings.
When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person 3

Vote Required.

Voting Rights.

Proxies.
(a) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after one year from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.
A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally.
(b) Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: (1) execution of a proxy may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder’s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person’s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; and (2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
(c) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

If voting stock is held of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants-in-common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one votes, such act binds all; (b) if more than one votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote such stock proportionally, or any person voting the shares, or a beneficiary, if any, may apply to the Court of Chancery or such other court as may have jurisdiction to appoint an additional person to act with the persons so voting the stock, which shall then be voted as determined by a majority of such persons and the person appointed by such court.

Right to Indemnification and Advancement.
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved or threatened to be involved (including involvement, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of the Corporation or as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an “indemnitee”), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees and related disbursements, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time (“ERISA”), penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in this Section 1 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section 1 of this Article VII shall be a contract right.
In addition to the right to indemnification conferred herein, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an “advance of expenses”); provided, however, that if and to the extent that the DGCL requires, an advance of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an “undertaking”), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced that such indemnitee is not entitled to be 18
indemnified for such expenses under this Section 1 of this Article VII or otherwise.
The Corporation may also, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation.Section 2.
Procedure for Indemnification.

If a determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved the request.
If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or advance of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within forty-five days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation (or, in the case of an advance of expenses, twenty days after a written request is received by the Corporation, provided that the director or officer has delivered the undertaking contemplated by Section 1 of this Article VII if required), the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article VII shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Such person’s costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.
It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant to Section 1 of this Article VII, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, a committee thereof, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, a committee thereof, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
The procedure for indemnification of other employees and agents for whom indemnification and advancement of expenses is provided pursuant to Section 1 of this Article VII shall be the same procedure set forth in this Section 2 of this Article VII for directors or officers, unless otherwise set forth in the action of the Board of Directors providing indemnification and advancement of expenses for such employee or agent.Section 3.
Insurance.
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expenses, liability or loss under the DGCL or otherwise.Section 4.
Service for Subsidiaries.
Any person serving as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity interests are owned by the Corporation (a “subsidiary” for this Article VII), shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such capacity at the request of the Corporation.
19
Section 5.
Reliance.
Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who, while a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights contained in this Article VII in entering into or continuing such service.
The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the adoption hereof.
Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.Section 6.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Continuation of Rights to Indemnification.
The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under the Certificate of Incorporation or under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
All rights to indemnification under this Article VII shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article VII is in effect.
Any repeal or modification of this Article VII or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses of such director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to any proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such repeal or modification.Section 7.
Merger or Consolidation.
For purposes of this Article VII, references to the “Corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.Section 8.
Savings Clause.
If this Article VII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and advance expenses to each person entitled to indemnification under Section 1 of Article VII as to all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees and related disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is available to such person pursuant to this Article VII to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.ARTICLE VIIIFORUM FOR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTESWith respect to any action arising out of any act or omission occurring after the adoption of these Bylaws, unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Certificate of Incorporate or these Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each 20
case subject to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction over the claim in question.

Limitation of Director’s Liability.
The Corporation hereby eliminates, to the fullest extent permitted by law (as contemplated by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL), the personal liability of any person who serves as a director of the Corporation to the Corporation and/or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director; provided, that this ARTICLE EIGHT shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for any acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the elimination or limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.
Any repeal or modification of this ARTICLE EIGHT shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any elimination or limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.B.
Right to Indemnification.
The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted or required by the DGCL or other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, unless applicable law otherwise requires, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who is or was made a party, or is threatened to be made a party, or who is or was involved in any manner (including, without limitation, as a witness), in any threatened, pending or completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (including, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) (collectively, a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of whom he or she is or was the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or who while a director or officer of the Corporation is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation) (collectively, an “Indemnitee”), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent, against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, costs, charges and related disbursements, judgments, fines, taxes, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time, penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) (collectively, “Expenses”) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such 71
Proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in this ARTICLE EIGHT with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by or on behalf of such Indemnitee only if the initiation of such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.
Each person who is or was serving as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent of a subsidiary of the Corporation shall be deemed to be serving, or have served, at the request of the Corporation.C.
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.
An Indemnitee seeking indemnification shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification upon submission of a written request, and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination.
The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnitee (a) did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or at least not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation or (b) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.
Furthermore, the knowledge or actions or failure to act of any other director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or other enterprise, as applicable, shall not be imputed to the Indemnitee for purposes of determining the Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification under this ARTICLE EIGHT.D.
Advancement of Expenses.
Such advances shall be made on an unsecured basis, shall be interest-free and shall be made without regard to the Indemnitee’s ability to repay such amounts and without regard to the Indemnitee’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under this ARTICLE EIGHT or otherwise.E.
Remedies of the Indemnitee.
(i) If a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this ARTICLE EIGHT: (a) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses either, at the Indemnitee’s sole option, (1) in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction or (2) in an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (b) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be de novo and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (c) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this ARTICLE EIGHT.
(ii) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within fifteen (15) days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (a) the Indemnitee intentionally misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in the written request for indemnification or (b) such indemnification is prohibited by the DGCL.
In the event that (1) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section D of this ARTICLE EIGHT or (2) payment of indemnification is not made within fifteen (15) days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Corporation’s obligation to pay the Indemnitee such advancement 72
of Expenses and indemnification.
It shall be a defense to any such action for judicial enforcement (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the written request therefor and the required undertaking, if any is required, has been received by the secretary of the Corporation) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense, by clear and convincing evidence, will be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(iii) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section E of ARTICLE EIGHT that the procedures and the presumptions of this ARTICLE EIGHT are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this ARTICLE EIGHT.
(iv) The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee against, and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any judicial adjudication, judicial enforcement, or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section E of ARTICLE EIGHT to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this ARTICLE EIGHT.F.

(ii) “Disinterested Director” shall mean a director of the Corporation who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by the Indemnitee.
(iii) Actions “in, or at least not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation” shall include, without limitation, actions taken in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan.G.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain D&O Insurance if the Corporation determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, the premium costs for such insurance are materially disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide a materially insufficient benefit, or such person is covered by substantially similar insurance maintained by a subsidiary of the Corporation or by another person pursuant to a contractual obligation owed to the Corporation.H.

Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this ARTICLE EIGHT shall not adversely affect any right or benefit of any potential Indemnitee existing at the time of such repeal or modification.J.
Indemnification of Other Employees.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to advancement by the Corporation of any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending any Proceeding, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this ARTICLE EIGHT with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of Expenses to directors and officers of the Corporation.K.
Severability.
If this ARTICLE EIGHT or any portion hereof shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then (i) the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with any Proceeding, including, without limitation, a grand jury proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by (a) any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have been invalidated, (b) the DGCL or (c) any other applicable law; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this ARTICLE EIGHT (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this ARTICLE EIGHT containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.L.
Contract Rights.
The provisions of this ARTICLE EIGHT shall be deemed to be a contract right between the Corporation and each person who is entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses pursuant to this ARTICLE EIGHT at any time while this ARTICLE EIGHT and the relevant provisions of the DGCL or other applicable law are in effect, and any repeal or modification of this ARTICLE EIGHT or any such law shall be prospective only, and shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of such person or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to any Proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such modification or repeal.ARTICLE NINEThe Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL.ARTICLE TENThe Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed herein and by the laws of the State of Delaware.

Right to Indemnification.
The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted or required by the DGCL or other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, unless applicable law otherwise requires, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who is or was made a party, or is threatened to be made a party, or who is or was involved in any manner (including, without limitation, as a witness), in any threatened, pending or completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (including, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) (collectively, a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of whom he or she is or was the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or who while a director or officer of the Corporation is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent of another Corporation or of a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation) (collectively, an “Indemnitee”), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, partner, principal, member, manager, fiduciary, employee, trustee or agent, against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, costs, charges, and related disbursements, judgments, fines, taxes, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) (collectively, “Expenses”) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in this Article V with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by or on behalf of such Indemnitee only if the initiation of such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.

Section 2.
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.
An Indemnitee seeking indemnification shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification upon submission of a written request, and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination.
The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnitee (i) did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or at least not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.
Furthermore, the knowledge or actions or failure to act of any other director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or other enterprise, as applicable, shall not be imputed to the Indemnitee for purposes of determining the Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification under this Article V.Section 3.
Advancement of Expenses.
Remedies of the Indemnitee.
(a) If a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Article V, (i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses either, at the Indemnitee’s sole option, (A) in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction or (B) in an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association, (ii) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be de novo and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination, and (iii) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Article V.(b) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within fifteen (15) days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (i) the Indemnitee intentionally misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in the written request for indemnification or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by the DGCL.
In the event that (A) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 3 of this Article V or (B) payment of indemnification is not made within fifteen (15) days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to this Article V, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Corporation’s obligation to pay the Indemnitee such advancement of Expenses and indemnification.
It shall be a defense to any such action for judicial enforcement (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the written request therefor and the required undertaking, if any is required, has been received by the Secretary) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense, by clear and convincing evidence, will be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the 83
Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(c) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 that the procedures and the presumptions of this Article V are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article V.(d) The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee against, and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any judicial adjudication, judicial enforcement or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Article V.Section 5.
Definitions.
For purposes of this Article V:(a) “Corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger that, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article V with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
(b) “Disinterested Director” means a director of the Corporation who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by the Indemnitee.
(c) Actions “in or at least not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation” shall include, without limitation, actions taken in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan.Section 6.
Insurance.
The Corporation shall purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or who while a director or officer is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (“D&O Insurance”), against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain D&O Insurance if the Corporation determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, the premium costs for such insurance are materially disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide a materially insufficient benefit, or such person is covered by substantially similar insurance maintained by a subsidiary of the Corporation or by another person pursuant to a contractual obligation owed to the Corporation.Section 7.
Service for Subsidiaries.
Any person serving as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity interests are owned by the Corporation (a “subsidiary” for this Article V), shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such capacity at the request of the Corporation.Section 8.
Reliance.
Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who, while a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a 84
director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights contained in this Article V in entering into or continuing such service.
The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article V shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the adoption hereof.
Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article V that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.Section 9.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Continuation of Rights to Indemnification.
The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under the Certificate of Incorporation or under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation.
The rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Article V shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
All rights to indemnification under this Article V shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article V is in effect.
Any repeal or modification of this Article V or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses of such director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to any proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such repeal or modification.Section 10.
Indemnification of Other Employees.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to advancement by the Corporation of any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending any Proceeding, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article V with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of Expenses to directors and officers of the Corporation.Section 11.
Severability.
If this Article V or any portion thereof shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then (a) the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with any Proceeding, including, without limitation, a grand jury proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by (i) any applicable portion of this Article V that shall not have been invalidated, (ii) the DGCL or (iii) any other applicable law; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article V (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article V containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.ARTICLE VICERTIFICATES OF STOCKSection 1.

The parties hereto may, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, negotiate in good faith for services not otherwise specifically identified in Schedule A (each, a “New Service”), provided that SuperMedia shall only provide Services that Servicer is providing under this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
Any agreement among the parties on the terms of any such New Service shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement and thereafter such New Service shall be a “Service” for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that (x) such amendment is in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreements and (y) an amended Schedule A is provided to the Administrative Agents under each of the Credit Agreements.
At all times during the performance of the Services, employees of the provider of the Services or other persons performing Services hereunder (including any agents, temporary employees, independent third parties and consultants) shall not be deemed to be employees of the persons receiving the Services on account of such Services.
Neither Servicer nor SuperMedia shall be required to perform any Services hereunder that conflict with or violate any Applicable Law or third-party rights.
(b) Service Standard.
Servicer and (until completion of the Integration) SuperMedia shall use the degree of skill, care and diligence in the performance of the Services that an experienced, qualified, prudent and reputable provider of similar services under a similar services agreement would use acting in like circumstances in accordance with applicable industry standards and all Applicable Laws, including all data protection and privacy laws.
Servicer and (until completion of the Integration) SuperMedia shall act honestly and in good faith in providing the Services and shall provide the Services to the Client Companies on a non-discriminatory basis and without mark-up or profit by Servicer or SuperMedia; provided that the Charges and Stewardship Costs may be marked up or provide a profit for Servicer if required by any Applicable Tax Law.
(c) Attorney-in-Fact.
(i) Subject to Section 2(c)(ii), each Client Company hereby appoints Servicer as such Client Company’s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Client Company and in the name of such Client Company or otherwise, from time to time in Servicer’s discretion, but subject to the direction of such Client Company, to take such actions on behalf of such Client Company as may be necessary or advisable for purposes of performing the Services.
(ii) Anything in Section 2(c)(i) or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Servicer is not authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of or as attorney-in-fact for any Client Company or to execute any amendment, modification or waiver to or under this Agreement or any other agreement to which Servicer is a party.3.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Direct Costs of a Client Company shall include the salary, benefits and severance costs of employees substantially all of the services provided by which are for the benefit of only such Client Company (“Client Company Employees”), including without limitation the employees providing sales and marketing services to such Client Company.
(ii) Allocated Costs.
The Charges to each Client Company under this Agreement shall include such Client Company’s Allocated Share of all costs incurred by Servicer that are not Direct Costs, including costs related to Services that have joint benefit for two or more Client Companies and Servicer’s overhead costs and costs paid by SuperMedia that have joint benefit for two or more Client Companies (which, after completion of the Integration, shall be zero) (collectively, “Allocated Costs”).
For the avoidance of doubt, Allocated Costs shall include the salary, benefits and severance costs of employees (other than Client Company Employees) that provide services for the benefit of two or more Client Companies (“Shared Employees”).
For the avoidance of doubt, Charges allocated to any Client Company as Direct Costs or Allocated Costs (including such Client Company’s share of any capital expenditures or capital lease obligations incurred by Servicer) shall also be allocated to such Client Company for financial statement purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, all Charges to an SM Client Company shall be deemed to be Charges to SuperMedia.
(c) Allocated Share.
Each Client Company’s “Allocated Share” for purposes of this Agreement shall be determined as follows:(i) For each Service that directly benefits a Client Company, such Client Company’s Allocated Share of the Allocated Costs for such Service shall be equal to such Client Company’s annual Net Revenue for the preceding calendar year divided by the total applicable annual Net Revenue of all of the Client Companies receiving the benefits of such Service for the same period (rounded to the nearest one percent); provided that the sum of the Allocated Shares of all Client Companies receiving the benefit of any Service must equal 100%.
The Client Companies’ initial Allocated Shares for Services shall be as set forth on Schedule B.
Effective as of January 1st of each calendar year during the term of this Agreement, and upon the addition or removal of any Client Company pursuant to Section 18, Servicer shall reset the Client Companies’ respective Allocated Shares for each Service in accordance with this Section 3(c)(i).
Upon final determination of any such reallocation by Servicer, Servicer shall submit for review and approval by each Client Company a written statement of such reallocation and the assumptions and calculations underlying such reallocation set forth in reasonable detail.
All changes to determinations of Direct Costs, Allocated Shares and Allocated Costs shall only apply on a prospective basis.
(ii) Each Client Company’s Allocated Share for purposes of Sections 4 and 6 shall be equal to each Client Company’s Allocated Share set forth in Section 3(c)(i) for a Service that benefits all of the Client Companies.
(iii) (A) Not less than once every five years during the term of this Agreement (such period initially commencing on the date of the Original Agreement) and (B) upon any acquisition or divestiture by Surviving Dex One Corp or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries of assets accounting (individually or in the aggregate with all other acquisitions or divestitures from the Effective Date) for at least 10% of the consolidated revenues or consolidated expenses of Surviving Dex One Corp and its subsidiaries (as reasonably determined by the board of directors of Surviving Dex One Corp acting in 188
good faith), Servicer shall commission a nationally recognized accounting firm or financial institution to review the fairness of the shared Allocated Costs and the corresponding allocation methodology set forth in this Section 3(c).
(d) Determination of Charges.
Servicer shall make all determinations and allocations of all Direct Costs to each Client Company and the determination of each Client Company’s Allocated Share and the allocation of Allocated Costs to each Client Company on a fair, reasonable and equitable basis in conformity with the principles set forth herein and as may be required by Applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, Servicer’s costs to be included in the Direct Costs and Allocated Costs shall include any and all costs of Servicer in performing the Services and otherwise in operating its business, including costs for labor, material, third-party services, overhead, taxes, legal services and information technology; provided, however, that in no event shall costs included in Direct Costs, Allocated Costs or Stewardship Costs include the allocation of indebtedness for borrowed money or interest expense in respect thereof.4.

Surviving Dex One Corp and (until completion of the Integration) SuperMedia provide certain services to Servicer and the other Client Companies that are not directly beneficial to Servicer or any individual Client Company, but which indirectly benefit all of Servicer and the other Client Companies, as further identified in Schedule C (collectively with any New Stewardship Services, the “Stewardship Services”).
The parties hereto may, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, negotiate in good faith for services not otherwise specifically identified in Schedule C (each, a “New Stewardship Service”).
Any agreement among the parties on the terms of any such New Stewardship Service shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement and thereafter such New Stewardship Service shall be a “Stewardship Service” for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that (x) such amendment is in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreements and (y) an amended Schedule C is provided to the Administrative Agents under each of the Credit Agreements.
Surviving Dex One Corp and (until completion of the Integration) SuperMedia incur certain costs associated with the Stewardship Services (collectively, “Stewardship Costs”).

Until completion of the Integration, Servicer shall credit SuperMedia for amounts paid for by SuperMedia for its costs associated with performing a Service that have been directly attributed to a Service for a Client Company, with a Service that has a joint benefit for two or more Client Companies or for Stewardship Costs incurred by SuperMedia.
Such credit shall be used in the monthly reconciliation described in Section 5(c).
(c) Monthly Reconciliation.
This monthly reconciliation statement shall include the following 189
information for the relevant period: (i) Charges for Services as described in Section 3; (ii) daily cash settlement amounts as described in Section 5(a); (iii) Services that have not yet been paid in cash by Servicer (or, until completion of the Integration, SuperMedia); (iv) Stewardship Cost reimbursement amounts as described in Section 4; (v) credit given for costs paid by such Client Company pursuant to Section 5(b) (if applicable); and (vi) overpayment or underpayment amounts as defined in Section 5(d).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of the overpayment or underpayment of any Client Company in any month is less than $100,000, no settlement payment or credit shall be made and the amount of such overpayment or underpayment will be rolled forward to be considered in the next month’s reconciliation until such time as the cumulative amount of such overpayment or underpayment exceeds $100,000, at which time such difference shall be paid or credited as set forth above.
(e) Annual Non-Cash Settlements.
Settlement of such non-cash Charges and Stewardship Cost reimbursements shall be handled by the parties with non-cash dividends or similar distributions or contributions that do not involve the transfer of property.6.

Servicer shall be permitted to invest the funds in the Funding Accounts in Permitted Investments.
Servicer shall have no liability to any Client Company for any losses associated with any Permitted Investment made by Servicer.
Any proceeds from any Permitted Investment made with funds from the any Funding Account shall be quantified on a monthly basis and applied as a credit to each Client Company in the next day’s settlements pursuant to Section 5(a), each such credit to be equal to each Client Company’s Allocated Share of such proceeds at the date of determination.7.
Contributions / Distributions of Services Assets.
All such contributions and distributions of Services Assets shall be conducted pursuant to separate agreement(s) or transaction(s) between the parties; provided that after the date of the contribution or distribution of all of the applicable Services Assets set forth on Schedule E for a Client Company, such Client Company shall not make any contribution or distribution of any Services Asset that was thereafter acquired by such Client Company in contemplation of such contribution or distribution.
The parties intend that such contributions and distributions shall include the Services Assets listed on Schedule E. Concurrently with the delivery of the financial statements required under Sections 5.01(a) and 5.01(b) of the applicable Credit Agreement, Servicer shall provide to the administrative agent under such Credit Agreement a schedule of the Services Assets contributed to Servicer during the previous fiscal quarter with a reasonably detailed description of such Services Assets and the value thereof (as determined by Servicer in good faith); provided, that such schedule need only include intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property has been (i) issued, registered, applied for or (ii) is material and proprietary, as determined by Servicer in good faith (unless, with respect to this clause (ii), such disclosure could harm the value of such intellectual property, e.g., trade secrets).

The Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, and the Distribution Agent, as applicable, shall not incur any liability whatsoever on account of any distributions under the Plan.
(c)    Accrual of Dividends and Other RightsFor purposes of determining the accrual of dividends or other rights after the Effective Date, Newdex Common Stock shall be deemed distributed as of the Effective Date regardless of the date on which it is actually issued, dated, authenticated, or distributed; provided, however, the Reorganized Debtors shall not pay any such dividends or distribute such other rights, if any, until after distributions of Newdex Common Stock actually take place.
(d)    Compliance MattersIn connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, the Reorganized Debtors and the Distribution Agent shall comply with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on them by any Governmental Unit, and all distributions pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to such withholding and reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the Reorganized Debtors and the Distribution Agent shall be authorized to take all actions necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting requirements, including liquidating a portion of the distribution to be made under the Plan to generate sufficient funds to pay applicable withholding taxes, withholding distributions pending receipt of information necessary to facilitate such distributions, or establishing any other mechanisms they believe are reasonable and appropriate.
The Reorganized Debtors reserve the right to allocate all distributions made under the Plan in compliance with all applicable wage garnishments, alimony, child support, and other spousal awards, liens, and encumbrances.
(e)    Foreign Currency Exchange RateExcept as otherwise provided in a Bankruptcy Court order, as of the Effective Date, any Claim asserted in currency other than U.S. dollars shall be automatically deemed converted to the equivalent U.S. dollar value using the exchange rate for the applicable currency as published in The Wall Street Journal, National Edition, on the Effective Date.
(f)    Fractional, Undeliverable, and Unclaimed Distributions   21
Such Certificate shall be cancelled solely with respect to the Debtors, and such cancellation shall not alter the obligations or rights of any non-Debtor third parties vis-à-vis one another with respect to such Certificate.
No distribution of property pursuant to the Plan shall be made to or on behalf of any such holder unless and until such Certificate is received by the Distribution Agent or the Servicer or the unavailability of such Certificate is reasonably established to the satisfaction of the Distribution Agent or the Servicer pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.3(h).
Any holder who fails to surrender or cause to be surrendered such Certificate or fails to execute and deliver an affidavit of loss and indemnity acceptable to the Distribution Agent or the Servicer prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date shall have its Claim or Interest discharged with no further action, be forever barred from asserting any such Claim or Interest against the relevant Reorganized Debtor or its property, be deemed to have forfeited all rights, and Claims and Interests with respect to such Certificate, and not participate in any distribution under the Plan; furthermore, all property with respect to such forfeited distributions, including any dividends or interest attributable thereto, shall revert to the Reorganized Debtors, notwithstanding any federal or state escheat, abandoned, or unclaimed property law to the contrary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, this Section 6.3(g) shall not apply to any Claims and Interests reinstated pursuant to the terms of the Plan.
Upon compliance with this procedure by a holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest evidenced by such a lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Certificate, such holder shall, for all purposes pursuant to the Plan, be deemed to have surrendered such Certificate.6.4    Claims Paid or Payable by Third Parties(a)    Claims Paid by Third PartiesA Claim shall be reduced in full, and such Claim shall be disallowed without a Claims objection having to be filed and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, to the extent that the holder of such Claim receives payment in full on account of such Claim from a party that is not a Debtor or Reorganized Debtor.
22
(b)    Claims Payable by Insurance CarriersOther than with respect to the SuperMedia Secured Credit Facility Claims, no distributions under the Plan shall be made on account of an Allowed Claim that is payable pursuant to one of the Debtors’ insurance policies until the holder of such Allowed Claim has exhausted all remedies with respect to such insurance policy.
Other than with respect to the SuperMedia Secured Credit Facility Claims, to the extent that one or more of the Debtors’ insurers agrees to satisfy in full a Claim (if and to the extent adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction), then immediately upon such insurers’ agreement, such Claim may be expunged to the extent of any agreed upon satisfaction on the Claims Register by the Claims and Solicitation Agent without a Claims objection having to be filed and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
(c)    Applicability of Insurance PoliciesExcept as otherwise provided herein, distributions to holders of Allowed Claims shall be in accordance with the provisions of an applicable insurance policy.
Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any Cause of Action that the Debtors or any Entity may hold against any other Entity, including insurers under any policies of insurance, nor shall anything contained herein constitute or be deemed a waiver by such insurers of any defenses, including coverage defenses, held by such insurers.6.5    SetoffsExcept as otherwise expressly provided for herein (including with respect to any SuperMedia Secured Credit Agreement Claims or Claims with respect to letters of credit as provided in the definition of Other Secured Claims), each Reorganized Debtor, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (including section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code), applicable non-bankruptcy law, or as may be agreed to by the holder of a Claim, may set off against any Allowed Claim and the distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan on account of such Allowed Claim (before any distribution is made on account of such Allowed Claim), any Claims, rights, and Causes of Action of any nature that such Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, may hold against the holder of such Allowed Claim, to the extent such Claims, rights, or Causes of Action against such holder have not been otherwise compromised or settled on or prior to the Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or otherwise); provided, however, that neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the allowance of any Claim pursuant to the Plan shall constitute a waiver or release by such Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims, rights, and Causes of Action that such Reorganized Debtor may possess against such holder.
In no event shall any holder of Claims be entitled to set off any Claim against any Claim, right, or Cause of Action of the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, unless such holder has filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court requesting the authority to perform such setoff on or before the Confirmation Date, and notwithstanding any indication in any Proof of Claim or otherwise that such holder asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of setoff pursuant to section 553 or otherwise.6.6    Allocation Between Principal and Accrued InterestExcept as otherwise provided in the Plan, the aggregate consideration paid to holders with respect to their Allowed Claims shall be treated pursuant to the Plan as allocated first to the principal amount of such Allowed Claims (to the extent thereof) and, thereafter, to the interest, if any, accrued through the Effective Date.ARTICLE VIIPROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED CLAIMS AND INTERESTS7.1    Disputed Claims ProcessExcept as otherwise provided herein, if a party files a proof of claim and the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, do not determine in their sole discretion, and without the need for notice to or action, 23
order or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, that the Claim subject to such proof of claim is Allowed, such Claim shall be Disputed unless Allowed or disallowed by a Final Order or as otherwise set forth in this ARTICLE VII.
Except as otherwise provided herein, all proofs of claim filed after the Effective Date shall be disallowed and forever barred, estopped, and enjoined from assertion, and shall not be enforceable against any Reorganized Debtor, without the need for any objection by the Reorganized Debtors or any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.7.2    Prosecution of Objections to Claims and InterestsExcept insofar as a Claim or Interest is Allowed under the Plan, the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or any other party in interest shall be entitled to object to the Claim or Interest.
All Claims and Interests not objected to by the end of such 120-day period shall be deemed Allowed unless such period is extended upon approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise provided in the Plan, from and after the Effective Date, each Reorganized Debtor shall have and retain any and all rights and defenses such Debtor had immediately prior to the Effective Date with respect to any Disputed Claim or Interest, including the Causes of Action retained pursuant to Section 4.15.7.3    No InterestUnless otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or by order of the Bankruptcy Court (including pursuant to the SuperMedia Cash Collateral Order), postpetition interest shall not accrue or be paid on Claims, and no holder of a Claim shall be entitled to interest accruing on or after the Petition Date on any Claim or right.
Additionally, and without limiting the foregoing, interest shall not accrue or be paid on any Disputed Claim with respect to the period from the Effective Date to the date a final distribution is made on account of such Disputed Claim, if and when such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim.7.4    Disallowance of Claims and InterestsAll Claims and Interests of any Entity from which property is sought by the Debtors under section 542, 543, 550, or 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or that the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors allege is a transferee of a transfer that is avoidable under section 522(f), 522(h), 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be disallowed if: (a) the Entity, on the one hand, and the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, on the other hand, agree or the Bankruptcy Court has determined by Final Order that such Entity or transferee is liable to turn over any property or monies under any of the aforementioned sections of the Bankruptcy Code and (b) such Entity or transferee has failed to turn over such property by the date set forth in such agreement or Final Order.ARTICLE VIIIEFFECT OF CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN8.1    Discharge of Claims and Termination of InterestsExcept as otherwise provided for herein and effective as of the Effective Date: (a) the rights afforded in the Plan and the treatment of all Claims and Interests shall be in exchange for and in complete satisfaction, discharge, and release of all Claims and Interests of any nature whatsoever, including any interest accrued on such Claims from and after the Petition Date, against the Debtors or any of their assets, property, or Estates; (b) the Plan shall bind all holders of Claims and Interests, notwithstanding whether any such holders failed to vote to accept or reject the Plan or voted to reject the Plan; (c) all Claims and Interests shall be satisfied, discharged, and released in full, and the Debtors’ liability with respect thereto shall be extinguished completely, including any liability of the kind specified under section 502(g) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (d) all Entities shall be precluded from asserting against the Debtors, 24

In no event shall any holder of Claims be entitled to set off any Claim against any Claim, right, or Cause of Action of the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, unless such holder has filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court requesting the authority to perform such setoff on or before the Confirmation Date, and notwithstanding any indication in any Proof of Claim or otherwise that such holder asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of setoff pursuant to section 553 or otherwise.6.6    Allocation Between Principal and Accrued InterestExcept as otherwise provided in the Plan, the aggregate consideration paid to holders with respect to their Allowed Claims shall be treated pursuant to the Plan as allocated first to the principal amount of such Allowed Claims (to the extent thereof) and, thereafter, to the interest, if any, accrued through the Effective Date.ARTICLE VIIPROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED CLAIMS AND INTERESTS7.1    Disputed Claims ProcessExcept as otherwise provided herein, if a party files a proof of claim and the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, do not determine in their sole discretion, and without the need for notice to or action, order or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, that the Claim subject to such proof of claim is Allowed, such Claim shall be Disputed unless Allowed or disallowed by a Final Order or as otherwise set forth in this ARTICLE VII.
Except as otherwise provided herein, all proofs of claim filed after the Effective Date shall be disallowed and forever barred, estopped, and enjoined from assertion, and shall not be enforceable against any Reorganized Debtor, without the need for any objection by the Reorganized Debtors or any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.7.2    Prosecution of Objections to Claims and InterestsExcept insofar as a Claim or Interest is Allowed under the Plan, the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or any other party in interest shall be entitled to object to the Claim or Interest.

Additionally, and without limiting the foregoing, interest shall not accrue or be paid on any Disputed Claim with respect to the period from the Effective Date to the date a final distribution is made on account of such Disputed Claim, if and when such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim.7.4    Disallowance of Claims and InterestsAll Claims and Interests of any Entity from which property is sought by the Debtors under section 542, 543, 550, or 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or that the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors allege is a transferee of a transfer that is avoidable under section 522(f), 522(h), 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be disallowed if: (a) the Entity, on the one hand, and the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, on the other hand, agree or the Bankruptcy Court has determined by Final Order that such Entity or transferee is liable to turn over any property or monies under any of the aforementioned sections of the Bankruptcy Code and (b) such Entity or transferee has failed to turn over such property by the date set forth in such agreement or Final Order.ARTICLE VIIIEFFECT OF CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN8.1    Discharge of Claims and Termination of InterestsExcept as otherwise provided for herein and effective as of the Effective Date: (a) the rights afforded in the Plan and the treatment of all Claims and Interests shall be in exchange for and in complete satisfaction, discharge, and release of all Claims and Interests of any nature whatsoever, including any interest accrued on such Claims from and after the Petition Date, against the Debtors or any of their assets, property, or Estates; (b) the Plan shall bind all holders of Claims and Interests, notwithstanding whether any such holders failed to vote to accept or reject the Plan or voted to reject the Plan; (c) all Claims and Interests shall be satisfied, discharged, and released in full, and the Debtors’ liability with respect thereto shall be extinguished completely, including any liability of the kind specified under section 502(g) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (d) all Entities shall be precluded from asserting against the Debtors, the Debtors’ Estates, the Reorganized Debtors, their successors and assigns, and their assets and properties any other Claims or Interests based upon any documents, instruments, or any act or omission, transaction, or other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Effective Date.8.2    Releases by the DebtorsPursuant to section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, for good and valuable consideration, on and after the Effective Date, the Released Parties are deemed released and discharged by the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, and the Estates from any and all Claims, obligations, rights, and liabilities whatsoever, whether for tort, fraud, contract, violations of F-29
