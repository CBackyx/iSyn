If payment of the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or Vesting Phantom Shares, as applicable, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(ii), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and Vesting Phantom Shares, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g).

None of the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration, Phantom Share Consideration or other amounts properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
If any Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing Cancelled Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount, pursuant to the policies and procedures of the transfer agent for Parent, as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g).

For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.
12  (h)            No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock.
No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from (A) the consideration to be paid by Parent or the Exchange Agent hereunder, (B) the Company DER Consideration and (C) any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

No dissenters’ or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions.

Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, unless dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock equal to the full amount of accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in Junior Stock or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such Junior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment with respect to any class or series of Parity Stock.
Unless full cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in Junior Stock or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such Junior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment with respect to any Junior Stock, nor shall any Junior Stock or Parity Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (except for purposes of an employee benefit plan) for any consideration, or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except by conversion or exchange for Junior Stock, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase Junior Stock), nor shall any other cash or property be paid or distributed to or for the benefit of holders of Junior Stock or Parity Stock.

Neither (i) an amendment of the Charter to authorize, create, or increase the authorized amount of Junior Stock or any shares of any class of Parity Stock, including additional Series B Preferred Stock, nor (ii) an Event, so long as the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of such Event the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock.
No such vote of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock as described above shall be required if provision is made to redeem all Series B Preferred Stock at or prior to the time such amendment, alteration or repeal is to take effect, or when the issuance of any such shares or convertible securities is to be made, as the case may be.
(e)            The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.
  (8)          Restrictions on Transfer, Acquisition and Redemption of Shares.
The Series B Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of the Corporation’s Charter, including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter; provided, however, that the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be applied to the Series B Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any other series or class.
The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the Series B Preferred Stock.
In addition to the legend contemplated by Article VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series B Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the following legend: “The Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class of stock.
The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation.
(10)        Settlement.
Nothing in this Article Second shall be interpreted to preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of the NYSE or other securities exchange or an automated inter-dealer quotation system.
THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the manner and by the vote required by law.
FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these Articles Supplementary for record.
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles Supplementary to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer and witnessed by its Secretary on [__________], 2021.
THE UNDERSIGNED, Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, who executed on behalf of the Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary of which this Certificate is made a part, hereby acknowledges in the name and on behalf of said Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary to be the corporate act of said Corporation and hereby certifies that the matters and facts set forth herein with respect to the authorization and approval thereof are true in all material respects under the penalties of perjury.
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Charter.
SECOND: The terms of the Preferred Stock as set by the Board and the pricing committee thereof, including preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption, are as follows: (1)            Designation and Number.
A series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, designated as “6.25% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), is hereby established.
The par value of the Series C Preferred Stock is $.0001 per share.
(2)            Rank.
The Series C Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Stock of the Corporation and to all equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that such equity securities rank junior to such Series C Preferred Stock; (b) on parity with the Parity Stock; and (c) junior to all equity securities issued by the Corporation the terms of which specifically provide that such equity securities rank senior to the Series C Preferred Stock.
The term “equity securities” shall not include convertible debt securities.
The term “Parity Stock” means all classes and series of preferred stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, with respect to the payments of distributions and rights to payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
  (b)            No dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be declared by the Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibit such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provide that such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.
(c)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock shall accrue whether or not the terms and provisions set forth in Section 3(b) hereof at any time prohibit the current payment of dividends, whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not such dividends are declared.
(d)            Except as provided in Section 3(e) below, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends (other than dividends in shares of Common Stock or dividends in shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be declared or made upon the Common Stock, or any Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any shares of Common Stock, or any shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation and except for transfers made pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter).
(e)            When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) on the Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other.
Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash, property or stock in excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock as described above.
(4)            Liquidation Preference.
(b)            In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of Parity Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and stockholders of such classes or series of Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.
(c)            After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
(e)            The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, trust or entity or of any other corporation with or into the Corporation, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
  (5)            Redemption.
Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not redeemable at any time by the Corporation or at the option of the holders thereof.
(6)            Conversion.
(a)             Conversion Rights.
Such holder shall surrender to the Corporation such shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (b) and (c) of this Section 6, as applicable.
  (iii)          A holder of Series C Preferred Stock is not entitled to any rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock until that holder has converted its Series C Preferred Stock, and only to the extent the Series C Preferred Stock are deemed to have been converted to shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.
(iv)          The Corporation shall, prior to issuance of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding into such Common Stock at any time (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares of Common Stock, all such shares of Series C Preferred Stock would be held by a single holder).
The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock shall upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable and free from all liens and charges and, except as provided in Section 6(c), taxes with respect to the issue thereof.
The Corporation further covenants that, if at any time the shares of Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange (including the Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq Capital Market) or quoted on an automated quotation system, the Corporation shall, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed or quoted, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed or quoted on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock.
Before the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
(b)            Corporation Conversion Option.
(i)            The Corporation shall have the option to require the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock to convert all of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock into that amount of Conversion Cash and that number of shares of Common Stock that are issuable at the Conversion Rate (as adjusted, the “Corporation Conversion Option”).
In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, the press release and Notice of a Corporation Conversion Option shall state, as appropriate: (1)            the Corporation Conversion Option Date; (2)            the amount of Conversion Cash to be payable and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each Series C Preferred Stock; (3)            the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted; and (4)            that dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be converted shall cease to accrue on the Corporation Conversion Option Date.
(iv)          Each conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the Corporation Conversion Option Date so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the Series C Preferred Stock being converted shall cease except for the right to receive the Conversion Cash and the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 7), and the person entitled to receive shares of Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of those shares of Common Stock at that time.
  (v)           In lieu of the foregoing procedures, if the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are held in global form, each holder of beneficial interest in Series C Preferred Stock must comply with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) to convert such holder’s beneficial interest in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by a global share of the Series C Preferred Stock.
(c)             Conversion Right Procedures.
In case the notice specifies that the Conversion Cash or shares of Common Stock are to be issued in a name or names other than that of the holder of Series C Preferred Stock, the notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the payment of the Conversion Cash and the issuance of shares of Common Stock in that name or names.
Other than those transfer taxes payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Conversion Cash or shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.
(iv)          In lieu of the foregoing procedures, if the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are held in global form, each holder of beneficial interest in Series C Preferred Stock must comply with the procedures of DTC to convert such holder’s beneficial interest in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by a global share of the Series C Preferred Stock.
(i)            Optional Conversion.
(A)           If a holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock exercises its Conversion Right, upon delivery of the Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall cease to cumulate dividends as of the end of the day immediately preceding the Conversion Date and the holder shall not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid dividends of the Series C Preferred Stock, except in those limited circumstances discussed in this Section 6(d).
Except as provided herein, the Corporation shall make no payment for accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series C Preferred Stock converted at a holder’s election pursuant to a Conversion Right, or for dividends on shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion.
(ii)           Corporation Conversion Option.
(7)            Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
(a)            If the Corporation shall, while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue Common Stock as a dividend or distributions to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock (other than pursuant to the Corporation’s existing dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan or any future dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan the Corporation adopts which is not materially adverse to the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and in any case which is without duplication subject to an adjustment under Section 7(e)), then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below) fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction:
An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for such determination.
If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 7(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
“Record Date” means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
(b)            If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, subdivide, combine reclassify, or split its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction: (i)            the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective; and (ii)           the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the day that such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective.
An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, reclassification, split or combination becomes effective.
An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(c) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such issuance.
If the shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities upon the expiration or termination of such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities have been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued (or the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of such other securities).
In determining whether any rights, warrants options, other securities, or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Closing Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, warrants options, other securities, or convertible securities, the value of such consideration if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
  (d)            (i) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all of the holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation and the shares of Common Stock are not changed or exchanged), shares of its capital stock, evidences of the Corporation’s indebtedness, or other assets or property, including securities, (including capital stock of any subsidiary of the Corporation) but excluding (i) dividends or distributions of Common Stock referred to in Section 7(a), (ii) any rights or warrants referred to in Section 7(c), (iii) dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash referred to in Section 7(e) and (iv) dividends and distributions of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) in connection with the reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 7 applies (such capital stock, evidence of its indebtedness, other assets or property or securities being distributed hereinafter in this Section 7(d) called the “Distributed Assets”), then, in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction: (A)           the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price; and (B)            the denominator of which shall be (x) such Current Market Price, less (y) the Fair Market Value (as defined below) on such date of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed with respect to each share of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date for such distribution.
“Fair Market Value” means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be made in good faith and, absent manifest error, shall be final and binding on holders of the Series C Preferred Stock).
An adjustment made pursuant to Section 7(d)(i) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such distribution.
If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(ii)           If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 7(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the “Reference Period”) used in computing the Current Market Price pursuant to this Section 7(d) to the extent possible, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the Fair Market Value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock.
(iii)           If any such distribution consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, one or more of the Corporation’s subsidiaries (a “Spin Off”), the Fair Market Value of the securities to be distributed shall equal the average of the Closing Sale Prices of such securities for the 10 consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the first Trading Day of those securities after the effectiveness of the Spin Off, and the Current Market Price shall be measured for the same period.
If, however, an underwritten initial public offering of the securities in the Spin Off occurs simultaneously with the Spin Off, Fair Market Value of the securities distributed in the Spin Off shall mean the initial public offering price of such securities and the Current Market Price shall mean the Closing Sale Price for the Common Stock on the same Trading Day.
  (iv)          Rights or warrants distributed by the Corporation to all or substantially all holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase equity securities of the Corporation (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (“Trigger Event”), (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock, (y) are not exercisable and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 7(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 7(d) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event.
If such right or warrant is subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of which such right or warrant shall become exercisable to purchase different Distributed Assets, or entitle the holder to purchase a different number or amount of the foregoing Distributed Assets or to purchase any of the foregoing Distributed Assets at a different purchase price, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be the date of issuance and Record Date with respect to a new right or warrant (and a termination or expiration of the existing right or warrant without exercise by the holder thereof).
In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto, that resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 7(d): (A)            in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share repurchase price received by a holder of shares Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such repurchase; and (B)            in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had never been issued.
(v)           For purposes of this Section 7(d) and Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and Section 7(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 7(d) is applicable that also includes (x) shares of Common Stock, (y) a subdivision, split or combination of shares of Common Stock to which Section 7(b) applies or (z) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 7(c) applies (or any combination thereof), shall be deemed instead to be: (A)           a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants, other than such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or warrants to which Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and Section 7(c) apply, respectively (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 7(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), immediately followed by
  (B)           a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate increase required by Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and Section 7(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except: (I)            the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as (i) “the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution,” “Record Date fixed for such determinations” and “Record Date” within the meaning of Section 7(a), (ii) “the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective” or “the day upon which such combination becomes effective” (as applicable) within the meaning of Section 7(b), and (iii) as “the Record Date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants” and such “Record Date” within the meaning of Section 7(c); and (II)           any reduction or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock resulting from such subdivision, split or combination (as applicable) shall be disregarded in connection with such dividend or distribution.
In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
(iii)          If the Corporation is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Corporation is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all such purchases or any or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would have been in effect based upon the number of shares actually purchased, if any.
If the application of this Section 7(f) to any tender offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this Section 7(f).
   (iv)          For purposes of this Section 7, the term “tender offer” shall mean and include both tender offers and exchange offers, all references to “purchases” of shares in tender offers (and all similar references) shall mean and include both the purchase of shares in tender offers and the acquisition of shares pursuant to exchange offers, and all references to “tendered shares” (and all similar references) shall mean and include shares tendered in both tender offers and exchange offers.
(g)           Notwithstanding the foregoing and to the extent permitted by law, whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to this Section 7, such adjustments shall be made as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Section 7 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
(h)           The Corporation shall be entitled to make such additional increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 7(a), Section 7(b), Section 7(c), Section 7(d), Section 7(e) or Section 7(f), if the Board of Directors determines that it is advisable, in order that any dividend or distribution of Common Stock, any subdivision, reclassification or combination of Common Stock or any issuance of rights or warrants referred to above, or any event treated as such for United States federal income tax purposes, shall not be taxable to the holders of Common Stock for United States federal income tax purposes or to diminish any such tax.
(i)            To the extent permitted by law, the Corporation may, from time to time, increase the Conversion Rate for a period of at least 20 Trading Days if the Board of Directors determines that such an increase would be in the Corporation’s best interests.
Any such determination by Board of Directors shall be conclusive.
(j)            The Corporation shall not adjust the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 7 to the extent that the adjustments would reduce the Conversion Price below $0.0001.
The Corporation shall not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least one percent in the Conversion Rate.
However, any adjustments that are not required to be made because they would have required an increase or decrease of less than one percent shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment of the Conversion Rate.
Except as described in this Section 7, the Corporation shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for any issuance of shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for its shares of Common Stock or rights to purchase its shares of Common Stock or such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities.
(k)           In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7, the holder of any Series C Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than Common Stock into which the Series C Preferred Stock originally were convertible, the Conversion Rate of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any such Series C Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in subparagraphs (a) through (1) of this Section 7, and any other applicable provisions of the Charter with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other shares.
  (l)            To the extent the Corporation has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall receive (except to the extent the Corporation settles its conversion obligations in cash), in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan unless the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock prior to the time of conversion, in which case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation made a distribution referred to in Section 7(d) above (without regard to any of the exceptions therein).
(8)          Consolidation or Merger of the Corporation.
(a)           In the case of the following events (each, a “Business Combination”): (i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock, other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of subdivision or a combination; (ii) a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange of the Corporation with another Person; (iii) a sale, conveyance or lease to another corporation of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation; or (iv) a statutory share exchange; in each case, as a result of which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, the Corporation or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall provide that the holders of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled thereafter to convert such Series C Preferred Stock into the Conversion Cash together with the kind and amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) which such holder of Series C Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive upon such Business Combination had such shares been converted into Conversion Cash and Common Stock immediately prior to such Business Combination.
If holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such Business Combination, the Corporation will make adequate provision whereby the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have a reasonable opportunity to determine the form of consideration into which all of the Series C Preferred Stock, treated as a single class, shall be convertible from and after the effective date of such Business Combination.
Such determination shall be based on the weighted average of elections made by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock who participate in such determination, shall be subject to any limitations to which all of the holders of Common Stock are subject, such as pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Business Combination, and shall be conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the earliest of (i) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of Common Stock, and (ii) two Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Business Combination.
If the effective date of the Business Combination is delayed beyond the initially anticipated effective date, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be given the opportunity to make subsequent similar determinations in regard to such delayed effective date.
The documents governing the rights of such securities shall provide for adjustments of the Conversion Rate and other appropriate numerical thresholds which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments of the Conversion Rate provided for in Section 7.
If, in the case of any such Business Combination, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a holder of shares of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such Business Combination, then such documents governing the rights of such securities shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Section 12(a) hereof.
Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such documents governing the rights of such securities.
(c)           The above provisions of this Section 8 shall similarly apply to successive Business Combinations.
(d)           The Corporation shall not become a party to any Business Combination unless its terms are consistent in all material respects with the provisions of this Section 8.
(e)           None of the provisions of this Section 8 shall affect the right of a Series C Preferred Stockholder to convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock prior to the effective date of a Business Combination.
(f)            If this Section 8 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 7 hereof shall not apply.
(9)          Notice of Adjustment.
Any Notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such Notice.
(10)        Notice in Certain Events.
In case of: (a)            a consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party and for which approval of any holders of Common Stock of the Corporation is required, or of the sale or conveyance to another person or entity or group of persons or entities acting in concert as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation; or
Failure to give such Notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the proceedings described in Section 10(a), Section 10(b) or Section 10(c).
(e)            If the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not in certificated form, a holder’s repurchase notice must comply with applicable DTC procedures.
(j)            In connection with a fundamental change repurchase, the Corporation shall comply with all U.S. federal and state securities laws in connection with any offer by the Corporation to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change.
(l)            A “fundamental change” shall be deemed to occur upon a change of control or a termination of trading.
(m)          A “change of control” shall be deemed to have occurred at such time, after the Effective Time of the merger of Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation, a Maryland corporation, with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, when the following has occurred: (i)            any “person” or “group” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) acquires the beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of transactions, of 50% or more of the total voting power of the Corporation’s total outstanding voting stock other than an acquisition by the Corporation or any of subsidiaries of the Corporation;
  (ii)            the Corporation consolidates with, or merges with or into, another person or conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of the Corporation assets to any person, or any person consolidates with or merges with or into the Corporation, other than: (1) any transaction (A) that does not result in any reclassification, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of the Corporation’s capital stock and (B) pursuant to which the Corporation’s capital stockholders immediately prior to the transaction have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of the Corporation’s capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the continuing or surviving person immediately after the transaction; or (2) any merger solely for the purpose of changing the Corporation’s jurisdiction of formation and resulting in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of common stock solely into shares of common stock of the surviving entity; or (iii)           the Corporation approves a plan of liquidation or dissolution.
(n)           A “termination of trading” is deemed to occur if the Common Stock (or other common stock into which the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are then convertible) is neither listed for trading on a United States national securities exchange nor approved for trading on an established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not constitute a change of control if 100% of the consideration for the Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters’ appraisal rights) in the transaction or transactions constituting the change of control consists of common stock traded on a United States National securities exchange (including the Nasdaq Global Market and Nasdaq Capital Market), or which shall be so traded when issued or exchanged in connection with the change of control, and as a result of such transaction or transactions the shares of Series C Preferred Stock become convertible solely into such common stock.
(12)        Voting Rights.
(a)           Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as set forth below.
  (c)            If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series C Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) hereof (subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent Preferred Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the current dividend period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full on all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall decrease by two.
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) (voting separately as a class with the Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable).
So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or, if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable).
The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
(d)           So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class, together with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable), (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking prior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock of the Corporation into any such shares, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; provided, however, that with respect to the occurrence of any event set forth in (ii) above, so long as the Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, the occurrence of any such event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock and; provided, further, that any increase in the amount of the authorized preferred stock, including the Series C Preferred Stock, or the creation or issuance of any additional Series C Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of such series, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.
  (13)        Restrictions on Transfer.
The Series C Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of the Charter, including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter; provided, however, that the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be applied to the Series C Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any other series or class.
The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the Series C Preferred Stock.
In addition to the legend contemplated by Article VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series C Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the following legend: “The Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class of stock.
Nothing in this Article Second of these Articles Supplementary shall be interpreted to preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange or other securities exchange (including Nasdaq) or an automated inter-dealer quotation system.
THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the manner and by the vote required by law.
FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these Articles Supplementary for record.
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles Supplementary to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer and witnessed by its Secretary on [__________], 2021.
THE UNDERSIGNED, Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, who executed on behalf of the Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary of which this Certificate is made a part, hereby acknowledges in the name and on behalf of said Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary to be the corporate act of said Corporation and hereby certifies that the matters and facts set forth herein with respect to the authorization and approval thereof are true in all material respects under the penalties of perjury.
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Charter.
SECOND: The terms of the Preferred Stock as set by the Board, including preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption, are as follows: (1)            Designation and Number.
A series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, designated the “8.625% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock” (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), is hereby established.
The par value of the Series B Preferred Stock is $.0001 per share.
(2)            Rank.
The Series B Preferred Stock will, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, rank (i) prior or senior to any class or series of common stock of the Corporation and any other class or series of equity securities, if the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such class or series (“Junior Stock”); (ii) on a parity with any class or series of the equity securities of the Corporation if, pursuant to the specific terms of such class or series of equity securities, the holders of such class or series of equity securities and the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to the receipt of dividends and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid dividends per share or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other (“Parity Stock”); (iii) junior to any class or series of equity securities of the Corporation if, pursuant to the specific terms of such class or series, the holders of such class or series are entitled to the receipt of dividends or amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in preference or priority to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock (“Senior Stock”); and (iv) junior to all of the existing and future indebtedness of the Corporation.
The term “equity securities” does not include convertible debt securities, which will rank senior to the Series B Preferred Stock.
Holders of Series B Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive any dividends in excess of cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at the dividend rate specified in this paragraph.
(b)            When dividends are not paid in full upon the Series B Preferred Stock or any other class or series of Parity Stock, or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, all dividends declared upon the Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Parity Stock shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends accumulated, accrued and unpaid on the Series B Preferred Stock and accumulated, accrued and unpaid on such Parity Stock.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, unless dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock equal to the full amount of accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in Junior Stock or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such Junior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment with respect to any class or series of Parity Stock.
Unless full cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in Junior Stock or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such Junior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment with respect to any Junior Stock, nor shall any Junior Stock or Parity Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (except for purposes of an employee benefit plan) for any consideration, or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except by conversion or exchange for Junior Stock, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase Junior Stock), nor shall any other cash or property be paid or distributed to or for the benefit of holders of Junior Stock or Parity Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be prohibited from (i) declaring or paying or setting apart for payment any dividend or distribution on any Parity Stock or (ii) redeeming, purchasing or otherwise acquiring any Junior Stock or Parity Stock, in each case, if such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or other acquisition is necessary to maintain the Corporation’s qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (“REIT”).
  (c)            No dividends on Series B Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board or declared or paid or set apart for payment at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement, including any agreement relating to the Corporation’s indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.
(d)            If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as “capital gain dividends” (as defined in Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code) any portion of the dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of capital stock, then the portion of the capital gains amount that shall be allocable to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be the amount that the total dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock for the year bears to the total dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of capital stock.
(e)            In determining for purposes of Section 2-311 of the Maryland General Corporation Law or otherwise under the Maryland General Corporation Law whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), by dividend, redemption or otherwise, is permitted, amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the liquidation preference of any series of preferred stock with preferential rights on dissolution senior to the Series B Preferred Stock (as discussed in Section 4 below) will not be added to the Corporation’s total liabilities.
(4)            Liquidation Preference.
If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, its assets, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the above described preferential amount and liquidating payments on any other shares of any class or series of Parity Stock, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any such other Parity Stock ratably in the same proportion as the respective amounts that would be payable on such Series B Preferred Stock and any such other Parity Stock if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.
  (b)            Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, any other series or class or classes of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.
(d)            None of a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another entity, a merger of another entity with or into the Corporation, a statutory stock exchange by the Corporation or a sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s property or business shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
(e)            The liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will not be added to the liabilities of the Corporation for the purpose of determining whether under the Maryland General Corporation Law a distribution may be made to stockholders of the Corporation whose preferential rights upon dissolution of the Corporation are junior to those of holders of Series B Preferred Stock.
Shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not redeemable at any time at the option of the holders thereof.
(6)            Redemption by the Corporation.
(a)            Redemption Right (i)            The Series B Preferred Stock shall not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption.
In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter pursuant to which Series B Preferred Stock owned by a stockholder in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit shall automatically be transferred to a Trust for the exclusive benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as provided in Article VII of the Charter.
Any date fixed for redemption pursuant to this Section 6 is referred to herein as a “Redemption Date.”
  (b)            Limitations on Redemption.
(i)            If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed at the option of the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(a) above, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board and the shares to be redeemed will be selected by the Board pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number of such shares held by such holders or by lot or by any other equitable manner as prescribed by the Board.
(ii)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid or authorized, declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
In addition, unless full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid or authorized, declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly for any consideration, nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of, any shares of Series B Preferred Stock or any other class or series of Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of any class or series of Junior Stock).
(iii)          The foregoing provisions of subsections 6(b)(i) and (ii) shall not prevent any other action by the Corporation pursuant to the Charter or otherwise in order to ensure that the Corporation remains qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of the exchange upon which the Series B Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed; and (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for cash.
Any such redemption may be made conditional on such factors as may be determined by the Board and as set forth in the notice of redemption.
If fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.
Any monies so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock at the end of two years after the Redemption Date shall be returned by such bank or trust company to the Corporation.
  (d)            Status of Redeemed Shares.
Any shares of Series B Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been redeemed shall, after such redemption, have the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock, without designation as to class or series until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular class or series by the Board.
(7)            Voting Rights.
(a)            Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as provided by law and as described below.
(b)            If and whenever dividends on any shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not such quarterly periods are consecutive (a “Preferred Dividend Default”), the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class with all other classes or series of capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (“Parity Preferred Stock”)) shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Corporation (the “Preferred Stock Directors”) who shall each be elected for one-year terms.
In such cases, the entire Board automatically shall be increased by two directors.
On any matter on which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote (as expressly provided herein or as may be required by law), including any action by written consent, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share, except that when shares of any other series of Preferred Stock shall have the right to vote with the Series B Preferred Stock as a single class on any matter, then the Series B Preferred Stock and such other class or series shall have with respect to such matters one vote per $25.00 of stated liquidation preference.
With respect to each matter on which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the holder of each share of Series B Preferred Stock may designate a number of proxies equal to the number of votes to which the share is entitled, with each such proxy having the right to vote a whole number of votes on behalf of such holder.
The procedures in this Section 7(b) for the calling of meetings and the election of directors will, to the extent permitted by law, supersede anything inconsistent contained in the Charter or Bylaws of the Corporation and, without limitation to the foregoing, the Bylaws of the Corporation will not be applicable to the election of directors by holders of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 7.
Notwithstanding the Bylaws of the Corporation, the number of directors constituting the entire Board will be automatically increased to include the directors to be elected pursuant to this Section 7(b).
So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if there is no such remaining director, by vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other such series of Parity Preferred Stock voting as a single class.
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other series of Parity Preferred Stock voting as a single class.
The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter presented to the Board.
(d)            The affirmative vote or consent of at least 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of all other classes or series of preferred stock entitled to vote on such matters, voting as a single class, in addition to any other vote required by the Charter or Maryland law, will be required to: (i) authorize the creation of, the increase in the authorized amount of, or the issuance of any shares of any class of Senior Stock or any security convertible into shares of any class of Senior Stock or (ii) amend, alter or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Charter, including the articles supplementary establishing the Series B Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or other business combination (in any such case, an “Event”) or otherwise if such action would materially adversely affect the powers, rights or preferences of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock.
Neither (i) an amendment of the Charter to authorize, create, or increase the authorized amount of Junior Stock or any shares of any class of Parity Stock, including additional Series B Preferred Stock, nor (ii) an Event, so long as the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of such Event the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock.
No such vote of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock as described above shall be required if provision is made to redeem all Series B Preferred Stock at or prior to the time such amendment, alteration or repeal is to take effect, or when the issuance of any such shares or convertible securities is to be made, as the case may be.
(e)            The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.
  (8)            Restrictions on Transfer, Acquisition and Redemption of Shares.
The Series B Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of the Corporation’s Charter, including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter; provided, however, that the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be applied to the Series B Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any other series or class.
The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the Series B Preferred Stock.
In addition to the legend contemplated by Article VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series B Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the following legend: “The Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class of stock.
The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation.
