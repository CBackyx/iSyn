(iv)    The Company effects a Distribution Transaction, in which case the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the Distribution Transaction shall be increased based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x [(FMV + MP0) / MP0]where,CR0    =    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the effective date of the Distribution Transaction;CR1    =    the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the effective date of the Distribution Transaction;FMV    =    the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average prices for a share of the capital stock or other interest distributed to holders of Common Stock on the principal United States securities exchange or automated quotation system on which such capital stock or other interest trades, as reported by Bloomberg (or, if Bloomberg ceases to publish such price, any successor service chosen by the Company) in respect of the period from the open of trading on the relevant Trading Day until the close of trading on such Trading Day (or if such volume-weighted average price is unavailable, the market price of one (1) share of such capital stock or other interest on such Trading Day determined, using a volume-weighted average method, by an Independent Financial Advisor retained for such purpose by the Company), for each of the ten (10) consecutive full Trading Days commencing with, and including, the effective date of the Distribution Transaction; andMP0    =    the arithmetic average of the VWAP per share of Common Stock for each of the ten (10) consecutive full Trading Days commencing on, and including, the effective date of the Distribution TransactionSuch adjustment shall become effective immediately following the close of business on the effective date of the Distribution Transaction.
