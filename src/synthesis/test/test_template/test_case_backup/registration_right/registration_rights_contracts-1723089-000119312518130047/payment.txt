The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of the Securities, together with borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, to fund a special cash payment (the “Cash Payment”) of approximately $700.0 million to Dover and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (as defined below).On the Closing Date, the Company will (i) issue the Notes and (ii) if the Spin-off Date will occur after the Closing Date, enter into a customary escrow and security agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) as contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Offering Memorandum, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as escrow agent and, as applicable, bank (the “Escrow Agent”), and the Trustee.
Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, if applicable, on the Closing Date the Company will deposit into an account pledged to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Securities (the “Escrow Account”) the proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with an additional amount, in cash (collectively with any other property from time to time held in the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent, the “Escrowed Funds”) that would be sufficient to redeem the Notes at a redemption price equal to the Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below).In the event that upon the earliest of any of the following to occur: (A) the Spin-off is not consummated on or prior to 5:00PM New York City time on May 31, 2018 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), (B) the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the Release Conditions (as defined in the Time of Sale Information and the Offering Memorandum) cannot be satisfied by the Escrow Outside Date or (C) the Board of Directors of Dover determines, in its sole discretion, that the Spin-off is not in the best interests of Dover or its shareholders, that a sale or other alternative is in the best interests of Dover or its shareholders, or that market conditions or other circumstances are such that it is not advisable at that time to separate certain assets and liabilities conducting its upstream oil and gas business within its Energy segment from Dover (any such event being a “Special Mandatory Termination Date”), the Company will redeem all of the Notes in accordance with the special mandatory redemption provisions contained in the Indenture (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (“Mandatory Redemption Price”).
(a) (i) To the extent the Spin-off is consummated on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and each of the Guarantors agrees to issue and sell the Securities to the several Initial Purchasers as provided in this Agreement, and each Initial Purchaser, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective principal amount of Securities set forth opposite such Initial Purchaser’s name in Schedule 1 hereto at a price equal to 98.25% of the principal amount thereof (the “Purchase Price”) plus accrued interest, if any, from May 3, 2018 to the Closing Date.
