(v)     by written notice by MoviePass if (A) there has been a breach by Helios of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Helios shall have become untrue or inaccurate, in any case, which would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Subsections 6.1 or 6.2 to be satisfied (treating the Closing Date for such purposes as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of such breach), and (B) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is not cured within the earlier of (x) twenty (20) days after written notice of such breach or inaccuracy is provided by MoviePass or (y) the Outside Date; provided, that MoviePass shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Subsection 7.18(a)(v) if at such time MoviePass is in material uncured breach of this Agreement;
(vi)     by written notice by Helios if the MoviePass Stockholder Approval is not received within the time period set forth in Subsection 5.23 of this Agreement; or
(b)     This Agreement may only be terminated in the circumstances described in Subsection 7.18(a) and pursuant to a written notice delivered by the terminating party to the other party, which sets forth the basis for such termination.
In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Subsection 7.18(a), this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability on the part of either party or any of their respective Representatives, and all rights and obligations of each party shall cease, except: (i) Subsections 4.7, 4.8 and 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any claim for common law fraud in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement against such party, in either case, prior to termination of this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, and except as provided in this Section 7, the parties’ sole right prior to the Closing with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement by the other party or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the right, if applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Subsection 7.18(a).
