(c) If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Common Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of the Demand Notice made pursuant to Section 1.2(a) and the Company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in Section 1.2(b)(i).
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall furnish to Holders requesting a registration statement pursuant to this Section 1.2, a certificate signed by the Company’s chief executive officer or the chairman of the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel and as evidenced by a resolution by the Board, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to be filed and it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such registration statement, the Company shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to such filing (but not the preparation of such registration statement) for a period of not more than sixty (60) days after receipt of the request of the Initiating Holders; provided, that the Company may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve-month period.

Whenever the Company is required by the provisions of this Agreement to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:(a) Prepare and file (within 45 days after the end of the period within which requests for registrations may be given to the Company) with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and keep such registration statement effective for period commencing on the effective date thereof and ending on and including the date that is 120 days thereafter (or, in the case of a registration statement filed pursuant to Section 1.2, that is effective on a Mandatory Conversion Event (as defined in the Restated Charter), or, if there is no such registration statement, the first registration statement filed pursuant to Section 1.2 that is declared effective after a Mandatory Conversion Event, ending on and including the date that is 365 days after the later of the Mandatory Conversion Event and the effective date of such registration statement) (such period, the “Required Effectiveness Period”) or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the registration statement has been completed.

(m) Promptly notify the Holders of Registrable Securities to be sold (or, in the case of the Taylor Holders, the Taylor Representative) and confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the SEC, (iii) of any request by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a registration statement or related prospectus, (iv) of the issuance by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus relating to such registration statement, or the initiation of any proceedings for such purpose(s), (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, - 11 -
(o) Cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement and the managing underwriter or agent, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive legends) representing securities sold under the registration statement, and enable such securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or agent (if any) or the Holders (or in the case of the Taylor Holders, the Taylor Representative) may request.
Each Holder shall be deemed to have agreed by acquisition of the Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in clauses (iv) through (vii) of subsection (m) of this section 1.6, such Holder will forthwith discontinue its disposition of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement relating thereto until Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subsection (e) of this section 1.6 and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in Holder’s possession of the prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.6, at any time after the applicable registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the Company may delay the disclosure of material non-public information concerning the Company the disclosure of which at the time is not otherwise required by Law if, in the good faith opinion of the Company after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel, the immediate disclosure of such information would be seriously detrimental to the Company(a “Grace Period”); provided, that the Company shall promptly (i) notify the Holders in writing of the existence of material non-public information giving rise to a Grace Period and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, and (ii) notify the Holders in writing of the date on which the Grace Period ends; and, provided further, that (A) no Grace Period shall exceed thirty (30) consecutive days, (B) during any 365 day period such Grace Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of sixty (60) days and (C) the first day of any Grace Period must be at least five (5) days after the last day of any prior Grace Period.
For purposes of the last proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the term prospectus” shall not be deemed to include the documents, if any, incorporated therein by reference, and no person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of Registrable Securities or any other person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, shall be obligated to send or give any supplement or amendment to any document incorporated by reference in any preliminary prospectus or the final prospectus to any person other than a person to whom such underwriter had delivered such incorporated document or documents in response to a written request therefor.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 1.9 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 1.9, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (or parties); provided, that the indemnified parties shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified parties by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified parties and the indemnifying party.
The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 1.9 to the extent so prejudiced, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 1.9.

(c) select any investment banker(s) or managing underwriter(s) as permitted under this Agreement;(d) deliver and receive documents, including any registration statements, prospectuses or amendments or supplements thereto, required under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to agree to waivers or modifications of any such documents;(e) execute and deliver such amendments, modifications, alterations and waivers to this Agreement from time to time as the Taylor Representative deems necessary or advisable; and(f) take any and all action on behalf of such Taylor Holder from time to time as the Taylor Representative may deem necessary or desirable to resolve and/or settle claims under this Agreement.At any time or from time to time, those Taylor Holders who hold a majority of the then Registrable Securities held by all Taylor Holders may designate, by a writing delivered to the Company, a successor Taylor Representative to serve in place of the Taylor Representative previously appointed.
Each of the Taylor Holders acknowledges and agrees that upon execution and delivery by the Taylor Representative of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications, alterations or waivers hereof or agreements, certificates and other documents executed and delivered by the Taylor Representative pursuant to Section 3.1 above, such Taylor Holder shall be bound by such documents as fully as if such Taylor Holder had executed and delivered such documents.
The Taylor Holders shall thereafter promptly provide the Company with written notice of such replacement.
