The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such issuance.
(a)  Immediately upon the issuance by the Letter of Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Lender that has a Revolving Credit Commitment (each such other Lender, in its capacity under this Section 3.3, an “L/C Participant”), and each such L/C Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from the Letter of Credit Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (each an “L/C Participation”), to the extent of such L/C Participant’s Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each substitute letter of credit, each drawing made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto (although Letter of Credit Fees will be paid directly to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the L/C Participants as provided in Section 4.1(b) and the L/C Participants shall have no right to receive any portion of any Fronting Fees).

A certificate submitted to the Borrower by the Letter of Credit Issuer or a L/C Participant, as the case may be, (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent) setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant as aforesaid shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent clearly demonstrable error.
(b)                                 if the reallocation described in clause (a) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (a) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.2(b) for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding;
