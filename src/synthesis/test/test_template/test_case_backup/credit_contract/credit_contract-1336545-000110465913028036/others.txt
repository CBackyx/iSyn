Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans.
If the Borrower Representative requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
(c)                                  Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan.
During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may (and shall at the direction of the Required Lenders) declare that no Loan may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans.
(d)                                 After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions to Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type, there shall not be more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect.

(i)                                     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue or cause to be issued Letters of Credit for the account of any Borrower or Credit Party, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued or caused to be issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor or cause to be honored drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of any Borrower or Credit Party and any drawings thereunder so long as that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) Total Revolving Credit Outstandings would not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility, (y) no Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed its Commitment, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit.

Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers and Credit Parties’ ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrowers and Credit Parties may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.
(iii)                               The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue or cause to be issued any Letter of Credit if:
52
(A)                               any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;
(B)                               the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer;
(D)                               such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; or

(F)                                 the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder.
(iv)                              The L/C Issuer shall not amend or cause to be amended any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue or cause to be issued such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.
(v)                                 The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend or cause to be amended any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue or cause to be issued such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.
53
(vi)                              The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving Credit Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it or which it causes to be issued and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it, which it caused to be issued or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.
(b)                                 Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.
In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require.
54
Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
With respect to any Auto-Extension Letter of Credit that has been issued, unless requested by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower Representative shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension.
55
(c)                                  Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.
(iii)                               With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans for any reason, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.
In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.
56
(iv)                              Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.
(v)                                 Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Credit Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by or caused to be made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)                                 Repayment of Participations.
57
thereon (whether directly from any Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Credit Lender’s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e)                                  Obligations Absolute.
The obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, under all circumstances, including the following:
(i)                                     any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;
(ii)                                  the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Borrower or any other Credit Party may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
(iii)                               any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
(iv)                              waiver by the L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for the L/C Issuer’s protection and not the protection of any Borrower or any waiver by the L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice any Borrower;
(v)                                 honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft;
58
(vii)                           any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower or any other Credit Party.
The Borrowers shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
(f)                                   Role of L/C Issuer.
Each Revolving Credit Lender and the Borrowers agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.
None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.
The Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.
None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrowers, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrowers which the Borrowers prove were caused by the L/C Issuer’s willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer’s willful failure to pay or cause to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
59
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.
(g)                                  Applicability of ISP and UCP; Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrowers, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to any Borrower for, and the L/C Issuer’s rights and remedies against any Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where the L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.
(h)                                 Letter of Credit Fees.
For purposes of computing the average daily stated amount for any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit on any date shall be the maximum amount then available to be drawn on such Letter of Credit.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate and shall be due and payable on demand by the Administrative Agent.

(a)                                 The Swing Line.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to advance a requested Revolving Credit Loan under Section 2.01 by making loans (each such loan, a “Swing Line Loan”) to any Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the Revolving Availability Period; provided that, after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan made on any particular date, the aggregate amount of all Swing Line Loans outstanding on such date shall not exceed the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit on such date, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations of the Revolving Credit Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Commitment so long as (x) after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (A) Overall Excess Availability would be greater than $0, (B) Total Revolving Credit Outstandings would not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility, and (C) except as noted above with respect to the Swing Line Lender, no Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed its Commitment and (y) no Borrower shall use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan.
Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow under this Section 2.04.
Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.
Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.

(ii)                                  If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Committed Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(iv)                              Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not
62
be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Credit Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.
No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
(d)                                 Repayment of Participations.
The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e)                                  Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender.
Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

Immediately upon (a) the sale or issuance by any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Capital Stock (other than Excluded Equity Issuances) or (b) the receipt of any capital contribution by any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries on account of any Capital Stock (other than capital contributions received on account of Excluded Equity Issuances and capital contributions received from a Credit Party or any Subsidiary of a Credit Party) issued by or in such Credit Party or such Subsidiary and subject to the terms of the Senior Notes Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrowers shall prepay the Obligations in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds so received (such prepayments shall be directed to a Concentration Account).
(f)                                   Incurrence of Indebtedness.
(g)                                  Daily Application of Funds in Concentration Accounts.
The Credit Parties hereby irrevocably agree that, on and after the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent may apply all funds held in the Concentration Accounts or received by the
64
Administrative Agent to the prepayment of the Obligations on a daily basis in accordance with Section 2.07.

All payments applied to the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) shall be applied to the Loans owing to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.
(d)                                 Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default of which the account officers of the Administrative Agent active on the Borrowers’ account have knowledge, the Administrative Agent may (and at the direction of the Required Lenders, shall) apply all funds transferred and credited to the Collection Account (or otherwise on account of the payment of the Obligations) to the Obligations in accordance with Section 8.03.

All computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a year of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).
Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day.
Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
2.11                        Evidence of Debt.
(a)                                 The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.
The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.

If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds promptly (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d)                                 Obligations of Lenders Several.
The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Credit Loans applicable to it, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans (in the case of Revolving Credit Lenders) and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint.
The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Credit Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Credit Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).
(e)                                  Funding Source.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
2.13                        Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Credit Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Credit Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the
70
aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Credit Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:
(i)                                     if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(ii)                                  the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement, (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.15 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Credit Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of the Borrowers (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.
2.14                        Collateral and Guarantees; Joint and Several Liabilities.

(b)                                 Guarantees.
Payment of the Loans and the other Obligations shall be unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor subject to the terms of the Guarantees.

The Obligations may be enforced by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against
71
any Borrower or all Borrowers in any manner or order selected by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their sole discretion.
Each Borrower hereby irrevocably waives (i) any rights of subrogation and (ii) any rights of contribution, indemnity or reimbursement, in each case, that it may acquire or that may arise against any other Borrower due to any payment or performance made under this Agreement, in each case until all Obligations shall have been fully satisfied.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14(d), each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:
(i)                                     its obligations under this Agreement shall remain enforceable against it even though such obligations may be unenforceable or not allowable against any other Credit Party due to the existence of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law involving any other Credit Party;
(ii)                                  its obligations under this Agreement are independent of the obligations of any other Credit Party, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against it in respect of such obligations irrespective of whether any action is brought against any other Credit Party or any other Credit Party is joined in any such action or actions;
(iii)                               it hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
(A)                               any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument relating thereto in respect of any other Credit Party;
(B)                               any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of any other Credit Party under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement, in respect of any other Credit Party;
(C)                               any change, restructuring or termination of the structure or existence of any other Credit Party;
(D)                               the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver any other agreement or the release or reduction of liability of any other Person with respect to any obligations of the Credit Parties under this Agreement; or
(E)                                any other circumstance (including any statute of limitations but other than the Obligations having been fully satisfied) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by any other Person that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any other Borrower;
72
(iv)                              its obligations under this Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any such obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Person upon the institution of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law of any other Credit Party, all as though such payment had not been made; and
(v)                                 it hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke its joint and several liability under the Loan Documents and acknowledges that such liability is continuing in nature and applies to all Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
2.15                        Cash Collateral.
(a)                                 Certain Credit Support Events.
(b)                                 Grant of Security Interest.
The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.15(c).
If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person (other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided) other than Senior Notes Liens in accordance with the Senior Notes Intercreditor Agreement, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrowers will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more non-interest bearing deposit accounts maintained by or with the
73
Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent shall designate.
(c)                                  Application.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.15 or Sections 2.16 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations (including for the purposes of Section 2.03(c)), obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
(d)                                 Release.
Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations (but for the avoidance of doubt, excluding Cash Collateral provided pursuant to Section 2.15(a)(iv)) shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination or reduction of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the reasonable determination by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, (x) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the Loan Documents and the other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents, and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.
Cash Collateral provided with respect to a Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit solely in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15(a)(iv) shall be promptly released to the Collection Account to be applied in accordance with Section 2.07(c) following the expiration or termination of such Cash Collateralized Letters of Credit.
2.16                        Defaulting Lenders.
(a)                                 Adjustments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(i)                                     Waivers and Amendments.
Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and Section 10.01.
(ii)                                  Defaulting Lender Waterfall.
74
the Administrative Agent, non-Defaulting Lenders and other Secured Parties have been paid in full.
The Administrative Agent may apply such amounts to the Defaulting Lender’s defaulted obligations, use the funds to Cash Collateralize such Lender’s Fronting Exposure, or readvance the amounts to the Borrowers hereunder.
(iii)                               Certain Fees.
(A)                               No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
(iv)                              Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.
All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower Representative shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower Representative shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment.
No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting
75
Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
(v)                                 Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans.
If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.15.
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.
2.17                        Overadvances and Protective Advances.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Borrowers shall be required to cure Overadvances and (ii) no Revolving Credit Lender shall be required to honor a
76
request for Overadvance Loans if Total Revolving Credit Outstandings exceed or would exceed the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect thereto.
Any funding of an Overadvance Loan or sufferance of an Overadvance shall not constitute a waiver by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of the Event of Default caused thereby.
In no event shall the Borrowers or any other Credit Party be deemed a beneficiary of this Section nor authorized to enforce any of its terms.
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent shall be authorized, in its discretion, at any time, whether or not a Default or Event of Default exists or any conditions in Section 4.02 are not satisfied, without regard to the amount of Overall Excess Availability to make loans (“Protective Advances”) if the Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems such Loans necessary or desirable to preserve or protect any Collateral or the Borrowers’ business operations, or to enhance the collectability or repayment of the Obligations; provided that (i) the aggregate amount of Overadvances and Protective Advances at the time of the making thereof by the Administrative Agent shall not exceed $5,000,000 after giving effect thereto and (ii) Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility after the making of any such Overadvances and Protective Advances.
Any funding of Protective Advances shall not constitute a waiver by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of the Event of Default caused thereby.
In no event shall the Borrowers or any other Credit Party be deemed a beneficiary of this Section nor authorized to enforce any of its terms.
2.18                        Loan Account.
(a)                                 The Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual and customary practices an account or accounts (“Loan Account”) evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrowers resulting from each Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit from time to time.
Any failure of the Administrative Agent to record anything in the Loan Account, or any error in doing so, shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers to pay any amount owing hereunder.
(b)                                 Entries made in the Loan Account shall constitute presumptive evidence of the information contained therein.
If any information contained in the Loan Account is provided to or inspected by any Person, then such information shall be conclusive and binding on such Person for all purposes absent manifest error, except to the extent such Person notifies the Administrative Agent in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt or inspection that specific information is subject to dispute.
77
The proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans may be disbursed as direct payment of the relevant Obligation.
In addition, the Administrative Agent is authorized to charge to the Loan balance on behalf of the Borrowers and cause to be paid all fees, expenses, charges, costs and interest and principal owing by the Borrowers under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, even if the amount of such charges would cause Overall Excess Availability to be less than $0.
To the extent permitted by law, any charges so made shall constitute part of the Loans hereunder.
2.19                        Borrower Representative.
The Borrower Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
The Administrative Agent and each Lender may regard any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document from the Borrower Representative as a notice or communication from all Credit Parties, and may give any notice or communication required or permitted to be given to any Credit Party hereunder to the Borrower Representative on behalf of such Credit Party or Credit Parties.
Each Credit Party agrees that each notice, election, representation and warranty, covenant, agreement and undertaking made on its behalf by the Borrower Representative shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such Credit Party and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Credit Party to the same extent as if the same had been made directly by such Credit Party.
2.20                        Reserves and Eligibility Criteria.
The Administrative Agent may, from time to time in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion, (x) establish, modify or eliminate Reserves and (y) adjust the eligibility criteria or establish new eligibility criteria with respect to Eligible Credit Card Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Raw Materials Inventory, Eligible Retail Inventory, Eligible Wholesale Finished Goods Inventory, and/or Eligible Wholesale Receivables.
It is understood and agreed that Reserves or eligibility criteria contained in the definitions of Eligible Credit Card Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Raw Materials Inventory, Eligible Retail Inventory, Eligible Wholesale Finished Goods Inventory, and/or Eligible Wholesale Receivables shall not duplicate any other Reserve or such eligibility criteria that are otherwise addressed or excluded through existing Reserves or such eligibility criteria.
All calculations of Overall Excess Availability in any Borrowing Base Certificate shall originally be made by the Borrower Representative and certified by a Financial Officer; provided that the Administrative Agent may from time to time review and adjust any such calculation (a) to reflect its reasonable estimate of declines in the value of any Collateral due to collections received in the Collection
78
Account or otherwise, (b) to adjust advance rates to reflect changes in dilution, quality, mix and other factors affecting the Collateral, and (c) to the extent the calculation is not made in accordance with this Agreement or does not accurately reflect the Reserves.

To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Borrowers may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Revolving Credit Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.
(d)                                 Effective Date and Allocations.

No increase pursuant to Section 2.15(a) shall increase the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit without the written consent of the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable.
ARTICLE III
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
3.01                        Taxes.
(a)                                 Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.
(i)                                     Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws.
If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent or Credit Party) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or a Credit Party, then the Administrative Agent or such Credit Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.
(ii)                                  If any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States
80
Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent or Credit Party shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent or Credit Party to be required taking into account the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent or Credit Party, to the extent required by the Code, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(iii)                               If any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required taking into account the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(b)                                 Payment of Other Taxes by the Credit Parties.
Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law (without duplication of the provisions of subsection (a) above), or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse the Administrative Agent for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(c)                                  Tax Indemnifications.
81
Governmental Authority.
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent or Credit Party shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties under this clause (ii).
(d)                                 Evidence of Payments.
82
(e)                                  Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) (ii)(D) and (ii)(E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s or Recipient’s reasonable judgment, as a result of a Change in Law, such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender or Recipient.
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a U.S.
Person,
(A)                               any Lender that is a U.S.
(I)                                   in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any
83
Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or any substantively comparable subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN (or any substantively comparable subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(II)                              executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any substantively comparable subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto);
(III)                         in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of “portfolio interest” a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1, G-2, G-3 or G-4 (each, a “U.S.
Tax Compliance Certificate”), as applicable, and duly executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or any substantively comparable subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto); or
84
of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(f)                                   Treatment of Certain Refunds.
Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of
85
such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be.
If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Credit Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Credit Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient in connection with such refund, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Credit Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Credit Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.
This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Credit Party or any other Person.
(g)                                  Survival.
Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
3.02                        Illegality.
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates, in each case, based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make Loans by reference to the Eurodollar Rate or to continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case, until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.
Until such circumstances giving rise to the determination no longer exist, as set forth in a written notice provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative, all outstanding Loans of such Lender and Loans thereafter made by such Lender shall bear interest at the Base Rate (determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate if necessary to avoid such illegality) plus the Applicable Rate
86
(or at the Default Rate if an Event of Default has occurred that is continuing) in the amount specified therein.
3.03                        Inability to Determine Rates.
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and/or Interest Period, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period or (c) the Eurodollar Rate with respect to a proposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender.
Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Loans at an interest rate based on the Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case, until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice and during such time, all such outstanding Loans shall bear interest at the Base Rate (determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate if necessary pursuant to clause (y) above) plus the Applicable Rate per annum (or at the Default Rate if an Event of Default has occurred that is continuing).
Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Committed Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
3.04                        Increased Costs.
(a)                                 Increased Costs Generally.
If any Change in Law shall:
(i)                                     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender or the L/C Issuer;
(ii)                                  subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)                               impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition (other than any condition related to Taxes), cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such
87
Lender or the L/C Issuer, by an amount that such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, deems to be material, of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall claim any amounts pursuant to Section 3.04(a)(ii) unless such Lender provides the Borrower Representative with a statement that it is generally seeking compensation with respect to such Taxes from similarly situated borrowers.
(b)                                 Capital Requirements.
If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)                                  Certificates for Reimbursement.
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law
88
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
3.05                        Compensation for Losses.
The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
3.06                        Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)                                 Designation of a Different Lending Office.
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower Representative such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be (it being understood that the Borrowers shall be given a reasonable opportunity to reimburse such costs or expenses).
The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)                                 Replacement of Lenders.
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to
89
designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.
3.07                        Survival.
All of the Borrowers’ obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Revolving Credit Facility and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

The obligation of each Lender to honor any Request for Credit Extension is subject to the following conditions precedent:
(a)                                 The representations and warranties of the Borrowers and each other Credit Party contained in Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct in all material respects (but without any duplication of any materiality qualifications) on and as of the date of such Credit Extension, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects (but without any duplication of any materiality qualifications) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 4.02, the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.02 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) respectively, of Section 6.04.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and neither any Borrower nor any other Credit Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions other than as provided in Section 9.10.
It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
(b)           The Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential holder of Bank Product Obligations) and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the collateral agent of such Lender and the L/C Issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Credit Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.
In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX and Article X (including Section 10.04(c), as though such
140
co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.

The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.
Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Credit Parties or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
9.03        Exculpatory Provisions.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.

(c)           shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Credit Parties or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable order.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.
The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.
In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.
The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Credit Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
9.05        Delegation of Duties.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.
The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
142
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.

The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor.

Each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential holder of Bank Product Obligations) and the L/C Issuer irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to and upon the commercially reasonable request of the Borrower Representative (and at its sole cost and expense) with reasonable advance notice, the Administrative Agent hereby agrees,
(a)           to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Revolving Credit Facility and payment in full in cash of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has then been asserted), and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer shall have been made), (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted hereunder (other than sales among Credit Parties), or (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders;

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Credit Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative
145
Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
Reports and other Borrower Materials may be made available to the Lenders by providing access to them on the Platform, but the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for system failures or access issues that may occur from time to time.
Each Lender agrees (a) that Reports are not intended to be comprehensive audits or examinations, and that the Administrative Agent or any other Person performing an audit or examination will inspect only specific information regarding the Obligations or Collateral and will rely significantly upon Borrowers’ books, records and representations; (b) that the Administrative Agent makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any Borrower Materials and shall not be liable for any information contained in or omitted from any Borrower Materials, including any Report; and (c) to keep all Borrower Materials confidential and strictly for such Lender’s internal use, not to distribute any Report or other Borrower Materials (or the contents thereof) to any Person (except to such Lender’s Participants, attorneys and accountants), and to use all Borrower Materials solely for administration of the Obligations.
Each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and any other Person preparing a Report from any action such Lender may take as a result of or any conclusion it may draw from any Borrower Materials, as well as from any claims, liabilities, obligations, judgments, interest, costs and expenses of any kind arising as a direct or indirect result of the Administrative Agent furnishing same to such Lender, via the Platform or otherwise.

In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims being estimated for such purpose if the fixing or liquidation thereof would not unduly delay the ability of the Administrative Agent to credit bid and purchase at such sale or other disposition of the Collateral and, if such claims cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of the Administrative Agent to credit bid, then such claims shall be disregarded, not credit bid, and not entitled to any interest in the asset or assets purchased by means of such credit bid) and the Secured Parties whose Obligations are credit bid shall be entitled to receive interests (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in relation to the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Capital Stock of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase).
146
confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release any such Liens on particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 9.09.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Bank Product Obligations and, in respect of Bank Product Obligations arising from Swap Contracts permitted under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Lender or its Affiliates in respect of any Swap Contract permitted hereunder unless such Lender or Affiliate has provided written certification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to the Administrative Agent as to amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received by the Administrative Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of any distribution in respect thereof.
The Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any such Bank Product Obligations arising from any Swap Contract permitted hereunder, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the relevant Lender or Affiliate of a Lender.
In the absence of an updated certification, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to a Lender or its Affiliate on account of a Swap Contract is the amount last certified to the Administrative Agent by such Lender or its Affiliate as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Lender or its Affiliate on account thereof).
9.12        Senior Notes Intercreditor Agreement.
Each Lender hereunder (a) agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of the Senior Notes Intercreditor Agreement, (b) authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to enter into the Senior Notes Intercreditor Agreement as the “Credit Facility Agent” (as defined therein) and on behalf of such Lender.

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (iv) the Administrative Agent’s Commitment Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.

No COLF Entity or any Related Party thereof shall have any liability to the Credit Parties, the Lenders or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) relating to use by any Person of the Platform or delivery of Borrower Materials and other information through the Platform.
No failure by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or material breach as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(e)           Payments.
(f)            Survival.
The agreements in this Section and the indemnity provisions of Section 10.02(d) shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Revolving Credit Facility and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.
To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Credit Party is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

(a)           Successors and Assigns Generally.
The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Credit Party (except to the extent permitted by Section 7.05(a) to the extent a transaction permitted thereby would
154
constitute an assignment) may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).

Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i)            Except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of any assignment, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower Representative otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.
(ii)           Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the Swing Line Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans.
155
(iii)          No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i) of this Section and, in addition:
(B)          the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and
(C)          the consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
(D)          the consent of the Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(v)           No such assignment shall be made (a) to any Credit Party or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of any Credit Party, (b) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (b), or (c) to a natural person.
(vi)          In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits and obligations of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.
Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
(c)           Register.
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
(d)           Participations.
157
(other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or any Credit Party or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of any Credit Party) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any  provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant.
The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.
Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers’ request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (solely for tax purposes), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
For
158
the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(e)           Certain Pledges.
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(f)            Electronic Execution of Assignments.
The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
(g)           Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.
In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder (with such Lender’s consent); provided, however, that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of COLF as L/C Issuer or COLF as Swing Line Lender, as the case may be.
If COLF resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).
If COLF resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).
Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to COLF to effectively assume the obligations of COLF with respect to such Letters of Credit.
159
(h)           Assignment by COLF Entities.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (x) no COLF Entity shall be required to comply with Section 10.06(b) in connection with any transaction involving any other COLF Entity or any of its or their lenders or funding or financing sources, none of the foregoing shall be considered an assignee hereunder and COLF shall have no obligation to disclose any such transaction to any Person, and (y) there shall be no limitation or restriction on (I) the ability of any COLF Entity to assign or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Commitment, or any Obligation to any other COLF Entity or any lender or financing or funding source of a COLF Entity or (II) any such lender’s or funding or financing source’s ability to assign or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Commitment, or any Obligation; provided, however, that COLF shall continue to be liable as a “Lender” under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents unless such other Person complies with the provisions of this Agreement to become a “Lender.”
10.07      Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to Section 2.15(c) or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrowers and their obligations, (g) on a confidential basis to any rating agency in connection with rating the Credit Parties or the Revolving Credit Facility, (h) with the consent of the Borrowers or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers.
For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrowers or any Credit Party relating to the Borrowers or any Credit Party or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers or any Credit Party, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrowers or any Credit Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation
160
to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrowers or a Credit Party, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including Federal and state securities Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.07, each Credit Party consents to the publication by the Administrative Agent of any press releases, tombstones, advertising or other promotional materials (including, without limitation, via any Electronic Medium) relating to the financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement using such Credit Party’s name, product photographs, logo or trademark.
No party hereto shall or shall permit any of its Affiliates to, issue any press release or other public disclosure relating to the closing of the credit facilities provided for herein (other than any document required to be filed by the Credit Party with the SEC) using the name, logo or otherwise referring to COLF, Capital One or of any of their Affiliates or the Loan Documents to which COLF, Capital One or of any of their Affiliates are a party to without the prior written consent (including via e-mail) of such Person (not to be unreasonably withheld) except to the extent required to do so under applicable Requirements of Law and then, only after consulting with such Persons.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time after obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of any Credit Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, the L/C Issuer or such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of such Credit Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness, provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.
The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have.
161
any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
10.09                 Interest Rate Limitation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”).
In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
10.10                 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.
This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.
Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.
10.11                 Survival of Representations and Warranties.
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.
Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.
10.12                 Severability.
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.
The
162
invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions of this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
10.13                 Replacement of Lenders.
If the Borrowers are entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then (x) the Borrowers may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent and (y) the Administrative Agent may upon notice to such Lender, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
(c)                                  in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(d)                                 such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and
(e)                                  in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have consented to such assignment and the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent;
provided that the failure by any Lender to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption in connection with any of the foregoing assignments shall not impair the validity of the removal of such Lender and the mandatory assignment of such Lender’s Commitments and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 10.13 shall nevertheless be effective without the execution by such Lender of an Assignment and Assumption.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling any Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
163
10.14                 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.
(a)                                 GOVERNING LAW.
(b)                                 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.
(c)                                  WAIVER OF VENUE.
EACH PARTY HERETO EACH IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN SUBSECTION (B) OF THIS SECTION.
164
(d)                                 SERVICE OF PROCESS.
NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
(e)                                  Waiver of Jury Trial.
(f)                                   Judicial Reference.
If any action or proceeding relating to any Obligations or Loan Documents is filed in a court sitting in or applying the Laws of California, the court shall, and is hereby directed to, make a general reference pursuant to Cal.
Civ.
Proc.
Code §638 to a referee (who shall be an active or retired judge) to hear and determine all issues in such case (whether fact or law) and to report a statement of decision.
Nothing in this Section shall limit any right of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise self-help remedies, such as setoff, foreclosure or sale of any Collateral, or to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, during or after any judicial reference.
The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of any party to resort to judicial reference.
At the Administrative Agent’s option, foreclosure under a mortgage or deed of trust may be accomplished either by exercise of power of sale thereunder or by judicial foreclosure.
10.15                 USA PATRIOT Act Notice.
Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined), the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Credit Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Credit Parties hereby waive and release any claims that they may have against the Administrative Agent and the Arranger with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.
