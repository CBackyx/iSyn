(d)In the event that the Borrowers or any Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantees) or repays (including by redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness included in the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (in each case, other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under this Agreement in the ordinary course of business for working capital purposes), (i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the55
 calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made, then the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period.
If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any hedging obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).
Interest on a Capitalized Lease shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrowers to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease in accordance with GAAP.
Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a London interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrowers or Subsidiary may designate.
The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of “LIBO Rate” or with respect to any rate that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any of such rate (including, without limitation, any LIBOR Successor Rate) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes.ARTICLE II

Amount and Terms of CreditSECTION 2.01Commitment of the Lenders.
(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, each Lender, severally and not jointly with any other Lender, agrees to make Loans and the Issuing Bank agrees to issue Letters of Credit, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers, subject in each case to the following limitations:(i)Total Outstandings (other than as a result of any Permitted Overadvance) shall not at any time exceed the Maximum Borrowing Amount at such time;(ii)No Lender shall be obligated to make any Credit Extension to the Borrowers, if after giving effect to such Credit Extension, Total Outstandings shall exceed the Revolving Credit Ceiling;(iii)No Lender shall be obligated to make any Credit Extension to the Borrowers, if after giving effect to such Credit Extension, the sum of (A) the outstanding principal amount of such Lender’s Revolving Credit Loans plus (B) an amount equal to such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of56
 the aggregate principal amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings and outstanding Permitted Overadvances, shall exceed such Lender’s Commitment; and(iv)The Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to issue, amend, or extend any Letter of Credit, if after giving effect to any such issuance, amendment or extension, the Letter of Credit Outstandings shall  exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit.
(b)The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.04(c) are several and not joint.
The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 9.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loans, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.04(c).SECTION 2.02Increase in Total Commitments.
(a)Increase of Total Commitments.
Any increase in the Total Commitments shall be made on the same terms (including, without limitation, interest terms, payment terms and maturity terms), and shall be subject to the same conditions as the Commitments of the existing Lenders.
(b)Conditions to Effectiveness of each Commitment Increase.
(d)Other Provisions.
In connection with Commitment Increases hereunder, the Lenders and the Borrowers agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Borrowers shall, in coordination with the Administrative Agent, (x) repay outstanding Loans of certain Lenders, and obtain Loans from certain other Lenders (including the Additional Commitment Lenders), or (y) take such other actions as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent, in each case to the extent necessary, to have all of the Lenders effectively participate in each of the outstanding Credit Extensions pro rata on the basis of their Commitment Percentages (determined after giving effect to any Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section58
The Administrative Agent shall have the right from time to time, in its Permitted Discretion, to establish, modify, or eliminate any applicable Reserves against the Borrowing Base, Eligible Credit Card Receivables and Eligible Inventory.SECTION 2.04Revolving Credit Loans.
(a)Borrowing Procedures.
(i)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a “Revolving Credit Loan”) to the Borrowers from time to time, on any Business Day prior to the Termination Date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender’s Commitment; provided that, after giving effect to such Revolving Credit Loan, each of the conditions set forth in Sections 2.01(a)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) shall be satisfied.
Revolving Credit Loans shall be either Prime Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans as the Borrowers may request.
All Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, be Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type.
Each Lender may fulfill its Commitment with respect to any Revolving Credit Loan by causing any lending office of such Lender to make such Revolving Credit Loan; provided, however, that any such use of a lending office shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Revolving Credit Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Within the limits of each Lender’s Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.14, and reborrow under this Section 2.04.
If no election of Interest Period is specified in any such notice for a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, such notice shall be deemed a request for an Interest Period of one (1) month.
If no election is made as to the Type of Revolving Credit Loan, such notice shall be deemed a request for Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans.
 p.m., in immediately available funds.
Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension on the Effective Date, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds received in respect of Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans available to the Borrowers in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the Loan Account with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers; provided, however, that if, on the date a Borrowing Request is made with respect to a Revolving Credit Loan, there are Letter of Credit Disbursements outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such Letter of Credit Disbursements, and second, shall be made available to the Borrowers as provided above.
(b)Conversion and Continuation of Revolving Credit Loans.
Each such Notice of Borrowing shall specify (1) whether the Borrowers are requesting a conversion of Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of LIBOR Loans, (2) the requested date of the conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (3) the principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans to be converted or continued, (4) the Type of Revolving Credit Loans to which existing Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted and (5) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary:(A)No Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans may be converted into, or continued as, LIBOR Loans at any time when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;(B)If less than a full Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans is converted, such conversion shall be made pro rata among the Lenders based upon their Commitment Percentages in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising such Borrowing held by such Lenders immediately prior to such conversion;(C)The aggregate principal amount of Prime Rate Loans being converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans shall be in an integral of $100,000 and at least $2,000,000;(D)Each Lender shall effect each conversion by applying the proceeds of its new LIBOR Loan or Prime Rate Loan, as the case may be, to its Revolving Credit Loan being so converted;(E)The Interest Period with respect to a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans effected by a conversion or in respect to the Borrowing of LIBOR Loans being continued as LIBOR Loans shall commence on the date of conversion or the expiration of the current Interest Period applicable to such continuing Borrowing, as the case may be;60
To the extent not paid by the Borrowers when due (after taking into consideration any applicable grace period), the Administrative Agent, without the request of the Borrowers, may advance any interest, fee, or other payment required under any Loan Document to which any Credit Party is entitled and may charge the same to the Loan Account notwithstanding that an Overadvance may result thereby and notwithstanding any failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 4.02; provided that such charges do not cause the Total Outstandings to exceed the Total Commitments at such time.
Such action on the part of the Administrative Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent's rights and the Borrowers’ obligations under Section 2.15(a).
(d)Notification of Interest Rate.
(e)Number of Interest Periods.
After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there not be more than six Interest Periods in effect with respect to the Loans.
(f)Cashless Settlement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all of the portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by each Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and such Lender.61
(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Borrowers shall request that Credit Parties make, or permit to remain outstanding, any Loans or Letters of Credit which shall cause an Overadvance, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to make, or permit to remain outstanding such Overadvance to the extent such Overadvance constitutes a Permitted Overadvance.
If a Permitted Overadvance is made, or permitted to remain outstanding, pursuant to the preceding sentence, then all Lenders shall be bound to make, or permit to remain outstanding, such Permitted Overadvance based upon their Commitment Percentage in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of whether the conditions to lending set forth in Section 4.02 have been met.
A Permitted Overadvance may be made as a Revolving Credit Loan or as an issuance of a Letter of Credit and each Lender and the Issuing Bank, as applicable, agrees to make any such requested Revolving Credit Loan or Letter of Credit available to the Borrowers.
The obligation of each Lender and the Issuing Bank, as applicable, to participate in each Permitted Overadvance shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Person may have against any other Credit Party, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (iii) any other occurrence, event or condition.
The making of any such Permitted Overadvance on any one occasion shall not obligate the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make or permit any Permitted Overadvance on any other occasion.
No funding of a Permitted Overadvance or sufferance of an Overadvance shall constitute a waiver by Administrative Agent or the Lenders of any Event of Default caused thereby.
In no event shall any Borrower or other Loan Party be deemed a beneficiary of this Section 2.05 nor authorized to enforce any of its terms.
(b)No Permitted Overadvance shall modify or abrogate any of the provisions of Section 2.11(d) or Section 2.11(g) regarding the Lenders’ obligations to reimburse any Letter of Credit Disbursement and to purchase participations with respect to Letter of Credit Disbursements, respectively.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no event or circumstance shall result in any claim or liability against the Administrative Agent for any “inadvertent Overadvances” resulting from changed circumstances beyond the control of the Administrative Agent (such as a reduction in the value of Collateral included in the Borrowing Base)), and such “inadvertent Overadvances” shall not reduce the amount of Permitted Overadvances allowed hereunder.
All other Overadvances (other than Permitted Overadvances) shall be payable in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.15(a).
All Permitted Overadvances and other Overadvances shall constitute Obligations secured by the Collateral and entitled to all benefits of the Loan Documents.SECTION 2.06Computation of Interest and Fees.
All computations of interest for Prime Rate Loans (including Prime Rate Loans determined by reference to the LIBO Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.
All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days62
Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.19(a), bear interest for one day.
Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.SECTION 2.07Evidence of Debt; Notes.
(a)The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.
The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.
Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.
In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
(b)In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.07(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit.
(ii)During the continuance of any Specified Event of Default, all outstanding Obligations hereunder shall bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.
All such interest shall be due and payable upon demand.
 times as may be specified herein.
Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.SECTION 2.09Inability to Determine Rates.
(a)If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBO Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Prime Rate Loan (in each case, with respect to clause (a)(i) above, “Impacted Loans”), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBO Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify each Borrower and each Lender.
Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Loans shall be suspended, to the extent of the affected LIBOR Loans or Interest Periods, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the LIBO Rate component of the Prime Rate, the utilization of the LIBO Rate component in determining the Prime Rate shall be suspended, in each case, until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders revokes such notice.
(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrowers or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of64
 Administrative Agent and the Borrowers may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing LIBOR or any then current LIBOR Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 2.09 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any Related Adjustments and any other mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated.
For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a LIBOR Successor Rate.
Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods), and (y) the LIBO Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Prime Rate, until the LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with clauses (b) or (c).
If any Lender determines that any Applicable Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to each Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender  to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension or continue LIBOR Loans or to convert Prime Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Prime Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Prime Rate, the interest rate on which Prime Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Prime Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and each Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such67
(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, at any time and from time to time after the Effective Date and prior to the Termination Date, the Borrowers may request the Issuing Bank to issue, and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, (A) the Issuing Bank shall, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this Section 2.11, issue, for the account of the Borrowers or a Subsidiary, one or more Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in each such Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Borrowers or its Subsidiaries and any drawings thereunder; provided, however, that no Credit Extension in respect of a Letter of Credit shall be made if after giving effect to such Credit Extension (i) the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings shall exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or (ii) any of the conditions set forth in Sections 2.01(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) would not be satisfied; provided, further, that no Letter of Credit shall be issued unless the Issuing Bank shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent that the conditions to such issuance have been met; provided further that any Letter of Credit issued for the benefit of any Subsidiary that is not a Borrower or a Guarantor shall be issued naming the Borrowers as the account party on any such Letter of Credit but such Letter of Credit may contain a statement that it is being issued for the benefit of such Subsidiary; provided further that the Issuing Bank shall not be required to make any Credit Extension in respect of any Letter of Credit, if, in its reasonable discretion: (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Applicable Law relating to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it, (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally, (C) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; or (D) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting68
 Lender, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (in its sole discretion) with the Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Bank’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.24(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit as to which the Issuing Bank has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.
The Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of, and promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent, upon receipt to, the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(g) to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(f)Immediately upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank (or the amendment of a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof), and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold to each Lender, and each such Lender shall be deemed unconditionally and irrevocably to have purchased from the Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each drawing thereunder and the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect thereto.
Upon any change in the Total Commitments pursuant to Section 2.02, Section 2.13, Section 2.15 or Section 9.06 of this Agreement, it is hereby agreed that with respect to all Letter of Credit Outstandings, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations hereby created to reflect the new Commitment Percentages of the assigning and assignee Lenders and the Additional Commitment Lenders, if applicable.
Any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with a Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for the Issuing Bank any resulting liability to any Lender.
Each Lender's obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.12(g), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may70
 have against the Issuing Bank, either Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any pother occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
No such reimbursement by the Lenders shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
Each Lender agrees to fund its Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment notwithstanding a failure to satisfy any applicable lending conditions or the provisions of Section 2.01 or Section 2.06, or the occurrence of the Termination Date.
The failure of any Lender to make available to the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall neither relieve any Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, nor increase the obligation of such other Lender.
Subject to the provisions of Section 2.24, whenever any Lender has made payments to the Issuing Bank in respect of any reimbursement obligation for any Letter of Credit, such Lender shall be entitled to share ratably, based on its Commitment Percentage, in all payments and collections thereafter received on account of such reimbursement obligation (whether directly from the Borrowers or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent).
(i)Subject to the limitations set forth below, the obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit Disbursement shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation (it being understood that any such payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to, and shall not constitute a waiver of, any rights the Borrowers might have71
 or might acquire hereunder as a result of the payment by the Issuing Bank of any draft or the reimbursement by the Borrowers thereof):  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of a Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any of the other Lenders, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (iv) waiver by the Issuing Bank of any requirement that exists for the Issuing Bank’s protection and not the protection of the Borrowers or any waiver by the Issuing Bank which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrowers; (v) honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft; (vi) any payment made by the Issuing Bank in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable; (vii) any payment by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; (viii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.11, constitute defense available to, a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, any Loan Party’s obligations hereunder; (ix) the fact that any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or (x) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates.
No Credit Party shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank.
The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or another independent tribunal having jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its reasonable discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(j)Each Lender and each Loan Party agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.
None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.
The Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers’ pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.
None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (x) of Section 2.11(i); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers may have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrowers, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrowers which the Borrowers prove were caused by the Issuing Bank’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Bank’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.

(i)Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Laws.

(d)Evidence of Payments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.21(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

 Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted , withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.
This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
(g)For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the Effective Date, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a “grandfathered obligation” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).(h)Survival.

The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or Issuing Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)Replacement of Lenders.
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.21 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.22(a), the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 9.13.SECTION 2.23Cash Collateral.89

All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.24(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.91

(A)No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Unused Fee pursuant to Section 2.17(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
(iv)Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.
All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letters of Credit shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrowers shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time) and (y) such reallocation does not cause the sum of (A) the outstanding principal amount of any Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Loans plus (B) an amount equal to such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings and outstanding Permitted Overadvances to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment.
Subject to Section 9.03, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
(v)Cash Collateral.
If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under Applicable Law, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Bank’s Fronting Exposure in accordance with procedures set forth in Section 2.23.

(vi)Certain Additional Payments.
In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Revolving Credit Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Commitment Percentage.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this155
 Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.14(b), 2.21 and 9.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle, or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or any Borrower or any of such Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Revolving Credit Loans (including such Lender’s participations in Letter of Credit Outstandings) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 9.01 that affects such Participant.
Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrowers156
 agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.14(b) and 2.21 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.06(b) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.21(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.06(b); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.22(b) as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.21 or 2.12, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.
Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at a Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with any Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.22(a) with respect to any Participant.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08(a) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 9.08(b) as though it were a Lender.
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(e)Certain Pledges.
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
In the event of any such resignation as the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Issuing Bank hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as the Issuing Bank.
If Bank of America resigns as the Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all of its Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as the Issuing Bank and all Obligations on account of such Letters of Credit (including the right to require the Lenders to make Revolving Credit Loans or fund risk participations in157
 Letter of Credit Disbursements pursuant to Section 2.11(g)).
Upon the appointment of a successor Issuing Bank, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, and (b) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit issued by Bank of America, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit.SECTION 9.07Confidentiality.

If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.
The obligation of the Borrowers in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.

(a)Each Loan Party is part of a group of affiliated Persons, and each Loan Party expects to receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the extension of the credit facility established pursuant to this Agreement.
In consideration of the foregoing, each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for all of the Obligations, whether now or hereafter existing or due or to become due and that the Obligations are the joint and several obligation of each Loan Party.
(b)The obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents may be enforced by the Administrative Agent any Loan Party or all Loan Parties in any manner or order selected by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their sole discretion.
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of each Loan Party hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any other Loan Party under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or under Applicable Law, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release of any Loan Party from, any of the terms or provisions of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or (iii) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the Collateral or other security held by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
(c)To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of each Loan Party to pay the Obligations in full hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Obligations after the167
 termination of all Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of each Loan Party hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Loan Party or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Loan Party as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations after termination of all Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document).
(d)To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Loan Party waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations after the termination of all Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document.
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any other Loan Party, or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Loan Party hereunder except to the extent that all the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and performed in full after the termination of Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document.

To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Loan Party waives any and all suretyship defenses.
(e)Upon payment by any Loan Party of any Obligations, all rights of such Loan Party against any other Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations for then unasserted claims) and the termination of all Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document.
If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Loan Party on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of any Loan Party, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that any Loan Party shall, under this Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay any of the Obligations constituting Loans made to another Loan Party hereunder (an “Accommodation Payment”), then the Loan168
 Party making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Loan Parties in an amount equal to a fraction of such Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other Loan Party’s Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Loan Parties.
As of any date of determination, the “Allocable Amount” of each Loan Party shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments which could be asserted against such Loan Party hereunder without (a) rendering such Loan Party “insolvent” within the meaning of Section 101 (31) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”) or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (“UFCA”), (b) leaving such Loan Party with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (c) leaving such Loan Party unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA.
(f)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, or of any other waiver or other provision set forth in this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Loan Party waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by any Credit Party, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed such Credit Party’s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against such Loan Party.
(g)Each Loan Party hereby agrees to keep each other Loan Party fully apprised at all times as to the status of its business, affairs, finances, and financial condition, and its ability to perform its Obligations under the Loan Documents, and in particular as to any adverse developments with respect thereto.
Each Loan Party hereby agrees to undertake to keep itself apprised at all times as to the status of the business, affairs, finances, and financial condition of each other Loan Party, and of the ability of each other Loan Party to perform its Obligations under the Loan Documents, and in particular as to any adverse developments with respect to any thereof.
Each Loan Party hereby agrees, in light of the foregoing mutual covenants to inform each other, and to keep themselves and each other informed as to such matters, that the Credit Parties shall have no duty to inform any Loan Party of any information pertaining to the business, affairs, finances, or financial condition of any other Loan Party, or pertaining to the ability of any other Loan Party to perform its Obligations under the Loan Documents, even if such information is adverse, and even if such information might influence the decision of one or more of the Loan Parties to continue to be jointly and severally liable for, or to provide Collateral for, the Obligations of one or more of the other Loan Parties.
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Loan Party hereby expressly waives any duty of the Credit Parties to inform any Loan Party of any such information.
(h)This joint and several obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 9.24 shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Loan Party is made, or the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission,169
 termination or reduction.
The obligations of the Loan Parties under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Agreement.
(i)Each Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Guarantee or the grant of the security interest under the Loan Documents, in each case, by any Specified Loan Party, becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Loan Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under its Guarantee and the other Loan Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this Section 9.23 voidable under Applicable Law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).
The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.
Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends this Section to constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of, each Specified Loan Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.
For the purposes of this Section 9.23(i), the term “Qualified ECP Guarantor” shall mean, at any time, each Loan Party with total assets exceeding $10,000,000 or that qualifies at such time as an “eligible contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act and can cause another person to qualify as an “eligible contract participant” at such time under §1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.SECTION 9.25Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender or Issuing Bank that is an Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:(a)the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender or Issuing Bank that is an Affected Financial Institution; and(b)the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:(i)a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;(ii)a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or170
 (iii)the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.SECTION 9.26Acknowledgment Regarding Any Supported QFCs.
(a)To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Contracts or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S.
Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.SECTION 9.27Amendment and Restatement.This Agreement is an amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement, it being acknowledged and agreed that as of the Effective Date, all obligations outstanding under or in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents (such obligations, collectively, the “Existing Obligations”) constitute obligations under this Agreement.
This Agreement is in no way intended to constitute a novation of the Existing Credit Agreement or the Existing Obligations.
With respect to (i) any date or time period occurring and ending prior to the Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall govern the respective rights and obligations of any party or parties hereto also party thereto and shall for such purposes remain in full force and effect, and (ii) any date or time period occurring or ending on or after the Effective Date, the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the other171
 Loan Documents.
From and after the Effective Date, any reference to the Existing Credit Agreement in any of the other Loan Documents executed or issued by and/or delivered to any one or more parties hereto pursuant to or in connection therewith shall be deemed to be a reference to this Agreement, and the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between such provisions and those of the Existing Credit Agreement.
