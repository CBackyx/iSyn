(g)           Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and Requirements of Law) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that would be payable or may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

(b)           If the Substitution Notice was properly issued under this Section 2.17, the Affected Lender shall sell, and the Substitute Institution shall purchase, all rights and claims of such Affected Lender under the Loan Documents and the Substitute Institution shall assume, and the Affected Lender shall be relieved of, the Affected Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitments and all other prior unperformed obligations of the Affected Lender under the Loan Documents (other than in respect of any damages (which pursuant to Section 11.5, do not include exemplary or punitive damages, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in respect of any such
73
unperformed obligations).
Such purchase and sale (and the corresponding assignment of all rights and claims hereunder) shall be recorded in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent and shall be effective on (and not earlier than) the later of (i) the receipt by the Affected Lender of its Ratable Portion of the Revolving Credit Outstandings, the Term Loans, together with any other Obligations owing to it, (ii) the receipt by the Administrative Agent of an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to it and the Borrowers whereby the Substitute Institution shall agree to be bound by the terms hereof and (iii) the payment in full to the Affected Lender in cash of all fees, unreimbursed costs and expenses and indemnities accrued and unpaid through such effective date.
Upon the effectiveness of such sale, purchase and assumption, the Substitute Institution shall become a “Lender” hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement having a Commitment in the amount of such Affected Lender’s Commitment assumed by it and such Commitment of the Affected Lender shall be terminated; provided, however, that all indemnities under the Loan Documents shall continue in favor of such Affected Lender.

As of the date of any such Event of Default under Section 9.1(f), all Peso Loans (together with any interest then accrued thereon) shall, immediately and without further action, become due and payable and, to the extent not otherwise repaid hereunder, the Company agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of any Mexican Lender entitled thereto, any amounts to which any Mexican Lender may be entitled to pursuant to Section 11.4 (Indemnities) and which shall not otherwise have been repaid by the Revolving Credit Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.18.

128
shall continue to, and shall be entitled to continue to, deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement, to the extent any such consent would reduce the principal amount of, or the rate of interest on, any Obligations, amend this clause (e) or postpone any scheduled date of payment of such principal or interest.
Each Special Purpose Vehicle shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15 (Capital Adequacy) and 2.16 (Taxes) and of 2.14(d) (Illegality) as if it were such Lender; provided, however, that anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Borrower shall, at any time, be obligated to make any payment under Section 2.15 (Capital Adequacy), 2.16 (Taxes) or 2.14(d) (Illegality) to any such Special Purpose Vehicle and any such Lender in excess of the amount the Borrowers would have been obligated to pay to such Lender in respect of such interest if such Special Purpose Vehicle had not been assigned the rights of such Lender hereunder; and provided, further, that such Special Purpose Vehicle shall have no direct right to enforce any of the terms of this Agreement against the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or the other Lenders.
The terms of such participation shall not, in any event, require the participant’s consent to any amendments, waivers or other modifications of any provision of any Loan Documents, the consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, or to the exercising or refraining from exercising any powers or rights such Lender may have under or in respect of the Loan Documents (including the right to enforce the obligations of the Loan Parties), except if any such amendment, waiver or other modification or consent would (i) reduce the amount, or postpone any date fixed for, any amount (whether of principal, interest or fees) payable to such participant under the Loan Documents, to which such participant would otherwise be entitled under such participation or (ii) result in the release of all or substantially all of the Collateral other than in accordance with Section 10.8(b) (Concerning the Collateral and the Collateral Documents).
In the event of the sale of any participation by any Lender, (w) such Lender’s obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (x) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties for the performance of such obligations, (y) such Lender shall remain the holder of such Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement and (z) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15 (Capital Adequacy) and 2.16 (Taxes) and of 2.14(d) (Illegality) as if it were a Lender; provided, however, that anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers shall not, at any time, be obligated to make any payment under Section 2.15 (Capital Adequacy), 2.16 (Taxes) or 2.14(d) (Illegality) to the participants in the rights and obligations of any Lender (together with such Lender) in excess of the amount the Borrowers would have been obligated to pay to such Lender in respect of such interest had such participation not been sold; and provided, further, that such participant in the rights and obligations of such Lender shall have no direct right to enforce any of the terms of this Agreement against the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or the other Lenders.
(g)                                 Any Issuer may at any time assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any other Lender by an instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, the Administrative Agent, such Issuer and such Lender, subject to the provisions of Section 2.7(b) (Evidence of Debt) relating to notations of transfer in the Register.
