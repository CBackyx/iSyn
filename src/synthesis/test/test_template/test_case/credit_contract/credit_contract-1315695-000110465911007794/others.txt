The Exchange Rates so determined shall become effective on the relevant Calculation Date (a “Recalculation Date”), shall remain effective until the next succeeding Recalculation Date, and shall for all purposes of this Agreement (other than any provision expressly requiring the use of a current Exchange Rate) be the Exchange Rates employed in converting any amounts between Dollars and Foreign Currencies.
(c)           For purposes of determining compliance under Sections 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11 with respect to any amount in a Foreign Currency, such amount shall be deemed to equal the Dollar Equivalent thereof based on the average daily Exchange Rate for such Foreign Currency for the most recent twelve-month period immediately prior to the date of determination determined in a manner consistent with that used in calculating Consolidated EBITDA for the related period.
For purposes of determining compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2, with respect to any amount of Indebtedness in a Foreign Currency, compliance will be determined at the time of incurrence thereof using the Dollar Equivalent thereof at the Exchange Rate in effect at the time of such incurrence.

1.3           Redenomination of Certain Foreign Currencies.
(a)  Each obligation of any party to this Agreement to make a payment denominated in Sterling on or after the date the United Kingdom adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the Closing Date shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption (in accordance with the EMU Legislation).
If, in relation to Sterling, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London Interbank Market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which the United Kingdom adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided, that if any Foreign Currency Borrowing in Sterling is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Foreign Currency Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.
(b)           Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by the United Kingdom and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

loans denominated in Dollars (each a “Dollar Revolving Credit Loan” and, collectively, the “Dollar Revolving Credit Loans” and, together with the Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Loans, the “Revolving Credit Loans”) to the Borrower, which Dollar Revolving Credit Loans (A) shall be made at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date and prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (B) may, at the option of the Borrower, be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into, ABR Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans; provided, that all Dollar Revolving Credit Loans made by each of the Lenders pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, consist entirely of Dollar Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type, (C) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof, (D) shall not, for any such Lender at any time, after giving effect thereto and to the application of the proceeds thereof, result in such Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure at such time exceeding such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment at such time and (E) shall not, after giving effect thereto and to the application of the proceeds thereof, result at any time in the aggregate amount of the Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures at such time exceeding the Total Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect;

If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available same to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender.
(c)           Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder).

Each Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans under this Agreement shall be granted by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their then-applicable Revolving Credit Commitments.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:
(a)           the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any conversion from a Borrowing of ABR Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;
(b)           if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month or begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;
(d)           the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period in respect of any Eurodollar Term Loan or any Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the applicable Maturity Date of such Loan.

(a)  In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):
50
(i)            on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period that (x) deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising such Eurodollar Borrowing and in the currency in which such Loan is to be denominated are not generally available in the relevant market or (y) by reason of any changes arising on or after the Closing Date affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or
(ii)           at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Eurodollar Loans (other than any such increase or reduction attributable to Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 5.4 and taxes imposed on the overall net income of such Lender) because of (x) any change since the Closing Date in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation, application or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order), such as, for example, without limitation, a change in official reserve requirements, and/or (y) other circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in such market; or
(iii)          at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date that materially and adversely affects the interbank Eurodollar market;
51
(c)           If, after the Closing Date, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation, application or administration thereof, or compliance by a Lender or its parent with any request or directive made or adopted after the Closing Date regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, association, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or its parent’s capital or assets as a consequence of such Lender’s commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or its parent could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or its parent’s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, promptly after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be entitled to such compensation as a result of such Lender’s compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any such law, rule or regulation as in effect on the Closing Date; provided that, for purposes of this Agreement (including this Section 2.10 and Section 3.5 hereto), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, guidelines or directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and been adopted after the Closing Date.
52
Section 2.13, release or diminish any of the Borrower’s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice.
If a Substitute Rate is agreed upon by the Borrower and all the Lenders, such Substitute Rate shall apply.

2.12         Change of Lending Office.
Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii), 2.10(a)(iii), 2.10(b), 3.5 or 5.4 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event; provided, that such
53
designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such Section.
Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4.
2.13         Notice of Certain Costs.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4 is given by any Lender more than 180 days after such Lender has knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts described in such Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be, for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the giving of such notice to the Borrower.
2.14         Incremental Facilities.
54
Any New Term Loans made on an Increased Amount Date shall be designated a separate series (a “Series”) of New Term Loans for all purpose of this Agreement.
On any Increased Amount Date on which any New Term Loan Commitments  of any Series are effective, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each Lender with a New Term Loan Commitment (each, a “New Term Loan Lender”) of any Series shall make a Loan to the Borrower (a “New Term
55
Loan”) in an amount equal to its New Term Loan Commitment of such Series, and (ii) each New Term Loan Lender of any Series shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the New Term Loan Commitment of such Series and the New Term Loans of such Series made pursuant thereto.
The terms and provisions of the New Term Loans and New Term Loan Commitments of any Series shall be, except as otherwise set forth herein or in the Joinder Agreement, identical to the Term Loans; provided, however, that (i) the applicable maturity date of each Series shall be no shorter than the final maturity of the Term Loans and (ii) the rate of interest applicable to the New Term Loans of each Series shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable new Lenders and shall be set forth in each applicable Joinder Agreement; provided further, that if the initial yield on any New Term Loans (as determined by the Administrative Agent to be equal to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar Rate (including any applicable Eurodollar Rate floor) plus the Applicable Eurodollar Margin applicable to the New Term Loans and (y) if the New Term Loans are initially made at a discount or the Lenders making the same receive a fee directly or indirectly from Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary for doing so (the amount of such fee, expressed as a percentage of the New Term Loans, being referred to herein as “OID”), the amount of such OID divided by the lesser of (A) the average life to maturity of such New Term Loans and (B) four) exceeds by more than 50 basis points (the amount of such excess above 50 basis points being referred to herein as the “Yield Differential”) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Eurodollar Margin then in effect for any Eurodollar Rate Term Loan, then the Applicable ABR Margin and the Applicable Eurodollar Margin then in effect for Term Loans shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential, effective upon the making of the New Term Loans (and if the Eurodollar Rate margins on the New Term Loans are subject to a leveraged-based pricing grid, appropriate increases to the other Applicable ABR Margin and Applicable Eurodollar Margin for the Term Loans, consistent with the foregoing, shall be made).
The terms and provisions of the New Revolving Loans and New Revolving Credit shall be identical to the Revolving Credit Loans and the Revolving Credit Commitments.
Each Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provision of this Section 2.14.

3.1           Letters of Credit.
56

(b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Dollar Equivalent of the Stated Amount of which, when added to the Letter of Credit Outstanding at such time, would exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment then in effect; (ii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Dollar Equivalent of the Stated Amount of which would cause the aggregate amount of the Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures at such time to exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect; (iii) each Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date occurring no later than one year after the date of issuance thereof, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer; provided, that any Letter of Credit may, upon request of the Borrower, provide for the automatic renewal thereof for additional consecutive periods of one year or less (which in no event shall extend beyond the L/C Maturity Date), subject to any conditions specified in such Letter of Credit; and provided further, that in no event shall such expiration date occur later than the L/C Maturity Date; (iv) each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency; (v) no Letter of Credit shall be issued if it would be illegal under any applicable law for the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit to have a Letter of Credit issued in its favor; and (vi) no Letter of Credit shall be issued by the Letter of Credit Issuer after it has received a written notice from the Borrower or any Lender stating that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing until such time as the Letter of Credit Issuer shall have received a written notice of (x) rescission of such notice from the party or parties originally delivering such notice or (y) the waiver of such Default or Event of Default in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.1.
57

(b)           In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall have no obligation other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.
Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for the Letter of Credit Issuer any resulting liability.

The failure of any L/C Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other L/C Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any payment under such Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no L/C Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other L/C Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent such other L/C Participant’s Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any such payment.
(e)           The obligations of the L/C Participants to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including under any of the following circumstances:

(iii)          any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
(iv)          the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

60
Such Dollar Revolving Credit Loans or Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Loans shall be made without regard to the Minimum Borrowing Amount.
The Administrative Agent shall use the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans solely for the purpose of reimbursing the Letter of Credit Issuer for the related Unpaid Drawing.
(b)           The Borrower’s obligations under this Section 3.4 to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower or any other Person may have or have had against the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including in its capacity as an L/C Participant), including any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit (each a “Drawing”) to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under the Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer.

The acceptance of any appointment as the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder by a successor Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, such successor Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the previous Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.
After the resignation of the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of a Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
After any retiring Letter of Credit Issuer’s resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer, the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Letter of Credit Issuer shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it (a) while it was Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement or (b) at any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer.

3.7                                 Defaulting Lenders and Letters of Credit.
If any Letter of Credit Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:
(a)                                  all or any part of such Letter of Credit Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage but only to the extent (x) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments and (y) no Default or Event of Default exists and is continuing;
(c)                                  if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to Section 3.7(b), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized;
(d)                                 if the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to Section 3.7(a), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Sections 4.1(b) or (c) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages; or
(e)                                  if any Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to Section 3.7(a), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and Letter of Credit Fees payable under Sections 4.1(b) or (c) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure shall be payable to the Letter of Credit Issuer until such Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated.
So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is reasonably satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 3.7(c).

SECTION 5.
65
Each prepayment in respect of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be applied to Classes of loans in such manner as the Borrower may determine and applied to reduce Term Loan Repayment Amounts in such order as the Borrower may determine.
At the Borrower’s election in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this Section 5.1, such prepayment shall not be applied to any Term Loan or Revolving Credit Loan of a Defaulting Lender.
As used in this Section 5.1, “Repricing Transaction” shall mean the prepayment or refinancing of all or a portion of the Term Loans concurrently with the incurrence by the Borrower of any long-term bank debt financing having lower cost financing than the Term Loans.
For avoidance of doubt, no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this Section 5.2(a)(i) for any Prepayment Events that have occurred prior to the Closing Date.

With respect to each prepayment of Term Loans required by Section 5.2(a), the Borrower may, subject to Section 5.2(c), designate the Types of Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which made; provided, that (i) Eurodollar Term Loans may be designated for
67
In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section 2.11.
(e)                                  Application to Revolving Credit Loans.
In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section 2.11.
(f)                                    Eurodollar Interest Periods.
Such deposit shall constitute cash collateral for the Obligations; provided, that the Borrower may at any time direct that such deposit be applied to make the applicable payment required pursuant to this Section 5.2.
68
(g)                                 Minimum Amount.
No prepayment shall be required pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(i) unless and until the amount at any time of Net Cash Proceeds from Prepayment Events required to be applied at or prior to such time pursuant to such Section and not yet applied at or prior to such time to prepay Term Loans pursuant to such Section exceeds the Dollar Equivalent of $15,000,000 in the aggregate.
(h)                                 Foreign Asset Sales.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 5.2, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any asset sale by a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to an Asset Sale Prepayment Event (a “Foreign Asset Sale”) are prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in this Section 5.2 but may be retained by the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Borrower hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later than two Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 5.2 and (ii) to the extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Asset Sale would have a material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds, the Net Cash Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary; provided, that, in the case of this clause (ii), on or before the date on which any Net Cash Proceeds so retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to reinvestments or prepayments pursuant to Section 5.2(a), (x) the Borrower applies an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds to such reinvestments or prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds had been received by the Borrower rather than such Restricted Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net Cash Proceeds had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Cash Proceeds that would be calculated if received by such Foreign Subsidiary) or (y) such Net Cash Proceeds are applied to the repayment of Indebtedness of a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary.
5.3                                 Method and Place of Payment.
69
the making of such payment to the extent of such funds held in such account.
All payments under each Credit Document (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) shall be made (i) in the case of the principal of and interest on each Loan, in the currency in which such Loan is denominated, (ii) in the case of reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit, in the currency in which such Letter of Credit is denominated, (iii) in the case of any indemnification or expense reimbursement payment, in Dollars or Euro, as requested by the Person entitled to receive such payment, or (iv) in all other cases, in Dollars, in each case except as otherwise expressly provided herein.
5.4                                 Net Payments.
(a)  All payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall, except as otherwise required by law, be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any current or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding (i) net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Agent or any Lender and (ii) any taxes imposed on any Agent or any Lender as a result of a current or former connection between such Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from such Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Credit Document); provided that, if any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings (“Non-Excluded Taxes”) are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to such Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement had such withholding not been required; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender (x) if such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 5.4, (y) that are with respect to U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed pursuant to FATCA or (z) that are with respect to any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed as a result of relocation of a Lender’s lending office except to the extent that such Lender was entitled, at the time of such relocation, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such
70
Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this Section 5.4.
In addition, if the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest, costs or penalties that may become payable by any Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
The agreements in this Section 5.4(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
For purposes of this Section 5.4, for the avoidance of doubt the term “Lender” shall include each Letter of Credit Issuer and L/C Participant.
(b)                                 Each Lender which is not a “United States person” as defined by Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “Non-U.S. Lender”) shall:
(iii)                               obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent;
71
unless in any such case any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders any such form inapplicable or would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
Each Person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 13.6 or a Lender pursuant to Section 13.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all the forms and statements required pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) if such Participant or Lender is not a “United States person” as defined by Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; provided, that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.
(e)                                  The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, or to pay any additional amounts to any Lender, in respect of U.S. Federal withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) above to the extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to U.S. Federal withholding tax existed on the date such Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Participant, on the date such Participant became a Participant hereunder); provided, however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to the extent that (x) the indemnity payments or additional amounts any Lender (or Participant) would be entitled to receive (without regard to this clause (i)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or additional amounts that the person making the assignment, participation or transfer to such Lender (or Participant) would have been entitled to receive in the absence of such assignment, participation or transfer, or (y) such assignment, participation or transfer had been requested by the Borrower, (ii) the
72
obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender or Participant to comply with the provisions of paragraph (b), (c) or (d) above or (iii) any of the representations or certifications made by a Lender or Participant pursuant to paragraph (b) above, which are, at the time of such payment, in effect and have not been superseded by subsequent representations or certificates, and the incorrectness of which necessarily results in the imposition of withholding tax pursuant to applicable law, are incorrect at the time a payment hereunder is made, other than by reason of any change in treaty, law or regulation having effect after the date such Lender became a party to this Agreement or such Participant purchased such participation.
(f)                                    If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any taxes for which indemnification has been demanded hereunder, the relevant Lender or Agent, as applicable, shall cooperate with such Borrower in challenging such taxes at such Borrower’s expense if so requested by such Borrower.
If any Lender or Agent, as applicable, receives a refund of a tax for which a payment has been made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the Borrower, then the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such amount (together with any interest received from the relevant Governmental Authority thereon) as the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position than it would have been in if the payment had not been required.
A Lender or Agent shall claim any refund that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its reasonable discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim.
Neither any Lender nor any Agent shall be obliged to disclose any information regarding its tax affairs or computations to the Borrower in connection with this paragraph (f) or any other provision of this Section 5.4.
(g)                                 Each Lender represents and agrees that, on the Closing Date and at all times during the term of this Agreement, it is not and will not be a conduit entity participating in a conduit financing arrangement (as defined in Section 7701(1) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) with respect to the Borrowings hereunder unless the Borrower has consented to such arrangement prior thereto.
5.5                                 Computations of Interest and Fees.
(a)  Interest on all Loans, except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.
(b)                                 Fees and Letter of Credit Outstanding shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.

Each Credit Party has duly executed and delivered each Credit Document to which it is a party and each such Credit Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.
Neither the execution, delivery or performance by any Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party nor compliance with the terms and provisions thereof nor the consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (a) contravene any applicable provision of any material law, statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, (b) result in any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or

(b)                                 The projections and pro forma financial information contained in the information and data referred to in paragraph (a) above were based on good faith estimates and assumptions believed by such Persons to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such projections as to future events are not to be
78
viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may differ from the projected results.

To the extent that any breach of any of the representations or warranties in this Section 8.10 relates to a period, event or action prior to the Closing Date in respect of which Holdings, the Borrower and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries are indemnified to the extent of the breach by any Seller pursuant to either Acquisition Agreement, there shall be deemed to be no breach thereof; provided, that such a breach will exist if the applicable Seller does not satisfy its indemnification obligations to the extent and in respect of the circumstances giving rise to such breach within a reasonable time of being notified by Holdings, the Borrower and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries of such circumstances (such Persons hereby agreeing to so notify the applicable Seller promptly of such circumstances).

SECTION 12.
The Administrative Agent
Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
10.1(o), 10.1(r) on their behalf (with such changes thereto as agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion).
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
106
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Credit Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.
Neither the Syndication Agent nor any of the Co-Documentation Agents, in their respective capacities as such, shall have any obligations, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement.
12.2         Delegation of Duties.
The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.
12.3         Exculpatory Provisions.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document (except for its or such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Credit Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or for any failure of any Credit Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Credit Party.
12.4         Reliance by Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing
107
to take any such action.
The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders (except to the extent that this Agreement requires that such action be taken only with the approval of the Required Lenders or each of the Lenders, as applicable).
12.6         Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.
Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any Credit Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of any Credit Party and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.
Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of any Credit Party.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, assets, operations, properties, financial condition, prospects or creditworthiness of any Credit Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.
108
The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective portions of the Total Credit Exposure in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their respective portions of the Total Credit Exposure in effect immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (including at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The agreements in this Section 12.7 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
12.8         Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity.
The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Credit Party as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.
With respect to the Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.
12.9         Successor Agent.
If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term “Administrative Agent” shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans.
After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 12 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.
109
12.10       Withholding Tax.
To the extent required by any applicable law, an Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax.
If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that an Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other reason or the Agent has paid over to the IRS or other Governmental Authority applicable withholding tax relating to a payment to a Lender but no deduction has been made from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify such Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by such Agent as tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall have no effect on any obligations of the Borrower hereunder.

Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the affected Lenders and shall be binding upon the Borrower, such Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the affected Loans.
In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, it being understood that no such waiver shall
111
extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon any sale or other transfer to any Person (other than the Borrower and any Restricted Domestic Subsidiary) by any Credit Party of any Collateral that is permitted under the Credit Agreement, the relevant Credit Party, together with the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, shall be permitted, without consent of any Lender, to amend, modify or waive any provision of the Pledge Agreement, the Security Agreement or the Mortgages, as applicable, to the extent necessary to effect release of the security interest in such Collateral.

benefits of Section 13.8(b) as though it were a Lender; provided, such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.8(a) as though it were a Lender.
A Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.4 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 5.4(b) as though it were a Lender.
(iii)          Each Lender that sells a participation, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of each Participant’s interest in the rights or obligations held by it (the “Participant Register”).
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such rights or obligations hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose any portion of such register to any Person except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to establish that the Loans or other interests hereunder are in registered form for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
(d)           Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided, that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
118
Affiliates in connection with such Lender’s credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement; provided, that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall provide to any Transferee or prospective Transferee any of the Confidential Information unless such person shall have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement in the form of Exhibit L.
13.7        Replacements of Lenders under Certain Circumstances.
The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, (b) is affected in the manner described in Section 2.10(a)(iii) and as a result thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to be taken or (c) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank or other financial institution; provided, that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) the Borrower shall repay (or the replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par) all Loans and other amounts (other than any disputed amounts, pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be) owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of replacement, (iv) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a Lender, and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (v) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.6 (provided, that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein) and (vi) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
(a)  If any Lender (a “benefited Lender”) shall, at any time during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 11.5, or otherwise) except pursuant to Section 13.6 or otherwise as permitted under this Agreement, in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender’s Loans, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender’s Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.
(b)           After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated
119
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower.
13.9        Counterparts.

13.10      Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
This Agreement and the other Credit Documents represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Credit Documents.

(b)           consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of

(c)           no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Credit Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.

If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Borrower or any other Credit Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the “Judgment Currency”) an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the Dollar Equivalent of such amount, in each case, as of the date immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the “Judgment Currency Conversion Date”).
(c)           For purposes of determining the Dollar Equivalent, such amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Permitted Amendment, the Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Permitted Amendment evidenced thereby and only with respect to the Loans and Commitments of the Accepting Lenders (including any amendments necessary to treat the Loans and Commitments of the Accepting Lenders in a manner consistent with the other Loans and Commitments under this Agreement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Permitted Amendment shall become effective under this Section 13.18 unless the Administrative Agent, to the extent so reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, shall have received legal opinions, board resolutions and officer’s certificates consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date.

Schedule 1.1(a)
ADDITIONAL COST FORMULAE
1.
The Additional Cost is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirement of the European Central Bank.
2.
3.
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Administrative Agent.
This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender’s participation in all Loans made from that Facility Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Facility Office.
4.
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows:
(a)
In relation to a Sterling Loan:
Per cent.
(b)
in relation to a Loan in any currency other than Sterling:
Per cent.
      300
Where:
A                                       is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
C                                       is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
5.
For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a)                                 “Eligible Liabilities” and “Special Deposits” have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;
(c)                                  “Fees Rules” means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;
(d)                                 “Fee Tariffs” means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.I.
Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fee rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate);
(e)                                  “Participating Member State” means any member state of the European Communities that adopts or has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency in accordance with legislation of the European Community relating to Economic and Monetary Union; and
(f)                                   “Tariff Base” has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
6.
In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e.
will be included in the formula as 5 and
not as 0.05).
A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.
The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
7.
8.
(a)           the jurisdiction of its Facility Office; and
(b)                                 any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
9.
The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of the Reference Lender for the purposes of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender’s obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.
10.
The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender including the Reference Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
11.
12.
Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Additional Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.
13.
The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Borrower and the Lenders, determine and notify to all parties to this Agreement any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

4.
Right of Set-off.
In addition to any rights and remedies of the Secured Parties provided by law, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes each Secured Party at any time and from time to time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default without notice to such Guarantor or any other Guarantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Guarantor, upon any amount becoming due and payable by such Guarantor hereunder (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Secured Party to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto.
When making any demand hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any Guarantor or guarantor, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or
5

For the purposes hereof, “demand” shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
7.
Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional.
Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, contraction, incurrence, renewal, extension, amendment, waiver or accrual of any of the Obligations, and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, the Obligations or any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended, waived or accrued, in reliance upon this Guarantee; and all dealings between the Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee.
Each Guarantor understands and agrees that this Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Letter of Credit or any Hedge Agreement, any of the Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) that may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrowers or any other Guarantor against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or such Guarantor) that constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for the Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance.
When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any other Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve such Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties against such Guarantor.
This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Guarantor and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and
6
their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, until all the Obligations under the Credit Documents shall have been satisfied by payment in full, the Commitments shall be terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement and any Hedge Agreement the Credit Parties may be free from any Obligations.
A Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder and the Guarantee of such Guarantor shall be automatically released upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such Guarantor ceases to be a Domestic Subsidiary of the Borrower.
Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 7 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
8.
Reinstatement.
This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
9.
Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim in Dollars at the Administrative Agent’s Office.
10.
Representations and Warranties; Covenants.
(a)           Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 8 of the Credit Agreement as they relate to such Guarantor or in the other Credit Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, are true and correct, and the Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party shall be entitled to rely on each of them as if they were fully set forth herein.
(b)           Each Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party that, from and after the date of this Guarantee until the Obligations under the Credit Documents are paid in full, the Commitments are terminated and no Letter of Credit remains outstanding, such Guarantor shall take, or shall refrain from taking, as the case may be, all actions that are necessary to be taken or not taken so that no violation of any provision, covenant or agreement contained in Section 9 or 10 of the Credit Agreement, and so that no Default or Event of Default, is caused by any act or failure to act of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.
7
(c)           Each Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that each of the waivers and consents set forth in this Guaranty is made voluntarily and unconditionally after consultation with outside legal counsel and with full knowledge of its significance and consequences, with the understanding that events giving rise to any defense or right waived may diminish, destroy or otherwise adversely affect rights which such Guarantor or any other obligor otherwise may have against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party or any other Person or against any collateral.
11.
Authority of Agent.

SECTION 4.
DEFAULT AND FORECLOSURE
4.1                                 Remedies.
If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Mortgagee may, at Mortgagee’s election, exercise any or all of the following rights, remedies and recourses: (a) declare the Indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, without further
4
notice, presentment, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand or action of any nature whatsoever (each of which hereby is expressly waived by Mortgagor), whereupon the same shall become immediately due and payable; (b) enter the Mortgaged Property and take exclusive possession thereof and of all books, records and accounts relating thereto or located thereon.
If Mortgagor remains in possession of the Mortgaged Property after an Event of Default and without Mortgagee’s prior written consent, Mortgagee may invoke any legal remedies to dispossess Mortgagor; (c) hold, lease, develop, manage, operate or otherwise use the Mortgaged Property upon such terms and conditions as Mortgagee may deem reasonable under the circumstances (making such repairs, alterations, additions and improvements and taking other actions, from time to time, as Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable), and apply all Rents and other amounts collected by Mortgagee in connection therewith in accordance with the provisions hereof; (d) institute proceedings for the complete foreclosure of this Mortgage, either by judicial action or by power of sale, in which case the Mortgaged Property may be sold for cash or credit in one or more parcels.
At any such sale by virtue of any judicial proceedings, power of sale, or any other legal right, remedy or recourse, the title to and right of possession of any such property shall pass to the purchaser thereof, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, Mortgagor shall be completely and irrevocably divested of all of its right, title, interest, claim, equity, equity of redemption, and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, in and to the property sold and such sale shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against Mortgagor, and against all other Persons claiming or to claim the property sold or any part thereof, by, through or under Mortgagor.
In the event this Mortgage is foreclosed by judicial action, appraisement of the Mortgaged Property is waived; (e)  make application to a court of competent jurisdiction for, and obtain from such court as a matter of strict right and without notice to Mortgagor or regard to the adequacy of the Mortgaged Property for the repayment of the Indebtedness, the appointment of a receiver of the Mortgaged Property, and Mortgagor irrevocably consents to such appointment.
Any such receiver shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers in similar cases, including the full power to rent, maintain and otherwise operate the Mortgaged Property upon such terms as may be approved by the court, and shall apply such Rents in accordance with the provisions hereof; and/or (f)  exercise all other rights, remedies and recourses granted under the Credit Documents or otherwise available at law or in equity.
4.2                                 Separate Sales.
The Mortgaged Property may be sold in one or more parcels and in such manner and order as Mortgagee in its sole discretion may elect; the right of sale arising out of any Event of Default shall not be exhausted by any one or more sales.
4.3                                 Remedies Cumulative, Concurrent and Nonexclusive.
Mortgagee shall have all rights, remedies and recourses granted in the Credit Documents and available at law or equity (including the UCC), which rights (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent, (b) may be pursued separately, successively or concurrently against Mortgagor or others obligated under the Credit Documents, or against the Mortgaged Property, or against any one or more of them, at the sole discretion of Mortgagee or the Lenders, (c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefor shall arise, and the exercise or failure to exercise any
5
of them shall not be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy or recourse, and (d) are intended to be, and shall be, nonexclusive.
No action by Mortgagee or the Lenders in the enforcement of any rights, remedies or recourses under the Credit Documents or otherwise at law or equity shall be deemed to cure any Event of Default.
4.4                                 Release of and Resort to Collateral.
Mortgagee may release, regardless of consideration and without the necessity for any notice to or consent by the holder of any subordinate lien on the Mortgaged Property, any part of the Mortgaged Property without, as to the remainder, in any way impairing, affecting, subordinating or releasing the lien or security interest created in or evidenced by the Credit Documents or their status as a first and prior lien and security interest in and to the Mortgaged Property.
For payment of the Indebtedness, Mortgagee may resort to any other security in such order and manner as Mortgagee may elect.
4.5                                 Waiver of Redemption, Notice and Marshalling of Assets.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Mortgagor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and releases (a) all benefit that might accrue to Mortgagor by virtue of any present or future statute of limitations or law or judicial decision exempting the Mortgaged Property from attachment, levy or sale on execution or providing for any stay of execution, exemption from civil process, redemption or extension of time for payment; (b) all notices of any Event of Default or of Mortgagee’s election to exercise or the actual exercise of any right, remedy or recourse provided for under the Credit Documents; and (c) any right to a marshalling of assets or a sale in inverse order of alienation.
Borrower waives the statutory right of redemption and equity of redemption.
4.6                                 Discontinuance of Proceedings.
If Mortgagee or the Lenders shall have proceeded to invoke any right, remedy or recourse permitted under the Credit Documents and shall thereafter elect to discontinue or abandon it for any reason, Mortgagee or the Lenders shall have the unqualified right to do so and, in such an event, Mortgagor and Mortgagee or the Lenders shall be restored to their former positions with respect to the Obligations, the Credit Documents, the Mortgaged Property and otherwise, and the rights, remedies, recourses and powers of Mortgagee or the Lenders shall continue as if the right, remedy or recourse had never been invoked, but no such discontinuance or abandonment shall waive any Event of Default which may then exist or the right of Mortgagee or the Lenders thereafter to exercise any right, remedy or recourse under the Credit Documents for such Event of Default.
4.7                                 Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds of any sale of, and the Rents and other amounts generated by the holding, leasing, management, operation or other use of the Mortgaged Property, shall be applied by Mortgagee (or the receiver, if one is appointed) in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
4.8                                 Occupancy After Foreclosure.
Any sale of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof will divest all right, title and interest of Mortgagor in and to the property sold.
Subject to applicable law, any purchaser at a foreclosure sale will receive immediate possession of the property purchased.
6
4.9.
Additional Advances and Disbursements; Costs of Enforcement.
If any Event of Default exists, Mortgagee and each of the Lenders shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure such Event of Default in the name and on behalf of Mortgagor in accordance with the Credit Agreement.
All sums advanced and expenses incurred at any time by Mortgagee or any Lender under this Section, or otherwise under this Mortgage or any of the other Credit Documents or applicable law, shall bear interest from the date that such sum is advanced or expense incurred if not repaid within five (5) days after demand therefor, to and including the date of reimbursement, computed at the rate or rates at which interest is then computed on the Indebtedness, and all such sums, together with interest thereon, shall be secured by this Mortgage.
Mortgagor shall pay all expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) of or incidental to the perfection and enforcement of this Mortgage and the other Credit Documents, or the enforcement, compromise or settlement of the Indebtedness or any claim under this Mortgage and the other Credit Documents, and for the curing thereof, or for defending or asserting the rights and claims of Mortgagee or the Lenders in respect thereof, by litigation or otherwise.
4.10                           No Mortgagee in Possession.
Neither the enforcement of any of the remedies under this Section, the assignment of the Rents and Leases under Section 5, the security interests under Section 6, nor any other remedies afforded to Mortgagee or the Lenders under the Credit Documents, at law or in equity shall cause Mortgagee or any Lender to be deemed or construed to be a mortgagee in possession of the Mortgaged Property, to obligate Mortgagee or any Lender to lease the Mortgaged Property or attempt to do so, or to take any action, incur any expense, or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability whatsoever under any of the Leases or otherwise.
SECTION 5.
ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES
5.1                                 Assignment.
In furtherance of and in addition to the assignment made by Mortgagor herein, Mortgagor hereby absolutely and unconditionally assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to Mortgagee all of its right, title and interest in and to all Leases, whether now existing or hereafter entered into, and all of its right, title and interest in and to all Rents.
This assignment is an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only.
So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Mortgagor shall have a revocable license from Mortgagee to exercise all rights extended to the landlord under the Leases, including the right to receive and collect all Rents and to hold the Rents in trust for use in the payment and performance of the Obligations and to otherwise use the same.
The foregoing license is granted subject to the conditional limitation that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
5.2                                 Perfection Upon Recordation.
Mortgagor acknowledges that Mortgagee has taken all reasonable actions necessary to obtain, and that upon recordation of this Mortgage Mortgagee shall have, to the extent permitted under applicable law, a valid and fully perfected, first priority, present assignment of the Rents arising out of the Leases and all security for such
7
Leases subject to the Permitted Liens and in the case of security deposits, rights of depositors and requirements of law.
Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that upon recordation of this Mortgage Mortgagee’s interest in the Rents shall be deemed to be fully perfected, “choate” and enforced as to Mortgagor and all third parties, including, without limitation, any subsequently appointed trustee in any case under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), without the necessity of commencing a foreclosure action with respect to this Mortgage, making formal demand for the Rents, obtaining the appointment of a receiver or taking any other affirmative action.
5.3                                 Bankruptcy Provisions.
Without limitation of the absolute nature of the assignment of the Rents hereunder, Mortgagor and Mortgagee agree that (a) this Mortgage shall constitute a “security agreement” for purposes of Section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) the security interest created by this Mortgage extends to property of Mortgagor acquired before the commencement of a case in bankruptcy and to all amounts paid as Rents, and (c) such security interest shall extend to all Rents acquired by the estate after the commencement of any case in bankruptcy.
SECTION 6.

Each Pledgor hereby appoints, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest, the Administrative Agent as such Pledgor’s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor or otherwise, to take any action and to execute any instrument or document, in each case after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Pledge Agreement, including to receive, indorse and collect all instruments made payable to such Pledgor representing any dividend, distribution or principal or interest payment in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same.
11.
The Administrative Agent’s Duties.
The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers.
Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Pledged Shares, whether or not the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.
The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property.
12.
Remedies.
If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:
(a)           The Administrative Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the NY UCC (whether or not the NY UCC applies to the affected Collateral) or otherwise available to it at law or in equity and also may without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange broker’s board or at any of the
8
Administrative Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such price or prices and upon such other terms as are commercially reasonable irrespective of the impact of any such sales on the market price of the Collateral.
Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal that it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
Each Pledgor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days’ notice to such Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification.
The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.
To the extent permitted by law, each Pledgor hereby waives any claim against the Administrative Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree.
(i)            first, to the payment of all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Pledge Agreement, the other Credit Documents or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document on behalf of any Pledgor and any other reasonable and documented costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Credit Document;
9
(iii)          third, any surplus then remaining shall be paid to the Pledgors or their successors or assigns or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.
Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
(c)           The Administrative Agent may exercise any and all rights and remedies of each Pledgor in respect of the Collateral.
(e)           Each Pledgor hereby consents to the transfer, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, of any Pledged Shares to the Administrative Agent or its designee and to the substitution, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, of the Administrative Agent or its designee as a partner, member or shareholder of the limited liability company, partnership or other entity that issued the Pledged Shares.
13.
Amendments, etc.
with Respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights.
Each Pledgor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding, without any reservation of rights against any Pledgor and without notice to or further assent by any Pledgor, (a) that any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may be rescinded by such party and any of the Obligations continued, (b) that the Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, (c) that the Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents, the Letters of Credit and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith and the Hedge Agreements and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith and any documents entered into with the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with treasury, depositary or cash management services or in connection with any automated clearinghouse transfer of funds may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, or, in the case of any Hedge Agreement or documents entered into with the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with treasury, depositary or cash management services or in connection with any automated clearinghouse transfer of funds, the party thereto) may deem advisable from time to time, (d) that any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall
10
have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Pledge Agreement or any property subject thereto.
When making any demand hereunder against any Pledgor, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any Pledgor or pledgor, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any Pledgor or pledgor or any release of the Borrower or any Pledgor or pledgor shall not relieve any Pledgor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any Pledgor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party against any Pledgor.

It is acknowledged that the First-Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the then extant Secured Credit Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, Refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in Section 2.01(a) or the provisions of this Agreement defining the relative rights of the First-Lien Secured Parties of any Series.

12
or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First-Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case so long as (A) the First-Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First-Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (B) the First-Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First-Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the First-Lien Secured Parties as set forth in this Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First-Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to Section 2.01, and (D) if any First-Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to Section 2.01; provided that the First-Lien Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First-Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the First-Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First-Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First-Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.
If any First-Lien Secured Party is granted adequate protection (A) in the form of Liens on any additional collateral, then each other First-Lien Secured Party shall be entitled to seek, and each First-Lien Secured Party will consent and not object to, adequate protection in the form of Liens on such additional collateral with the same priority vis-à-vis the First-Lien Secured Parties as set forth in this Agreement, (B) in the form of a superpriority or other administrative claim, then each other First-Lien Secured Party shall be entitled to seek, and each First-Lien Secured Party will consent and not object to, adequate protection in the form of a pari passu superpriority or administrative claim or (C) in the form of periodic or other cash payments, then the proceeds of such adequate protection must be applied to all First-Lien Obligations pursuant to Section 2.01.

SECTION 2.

Without limiting the foregoing, each Non-Controlling Secured Party agrees that none of the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First-Lien Secured Party shall have any duty or obligation first to marshal or realize upon any type of Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any of the First-Lien Obligations), or to sell, dispose of or otherwise liquidate all or any portion of such Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any First-Lien Obligations), in any manner that would maximize the return to the Non-Controlling Secured Parties, notwithstanding that the order and timing of any such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation may affect the amount of proceeds actually received by the Non-Controlling Secured Parties from such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation.
Each of the First-Lien Secured Parties waives any claim it may now or hereafter have against any Collateral Agent or the Authorized Representative of any other Series of First-Lien Obligations or any other First-Lien Secured Party of any other Series arising out of (i) any actions which any Collateral Agent, Authorized Representative or the First-Lien Secured Parties take or omit to take (including, actions with respect to the creation, perfection or continuation of Liens on any Collateral, actions with respect to the foreclosure upon, sale, release or depreciation of, or failure to realize upon, any of the Collateral and actions with respect to the collection of any claim for all or any part of the First-Lien Obligations from any account debtor, guarantor or any other party) in accordance with the First-Lien Security Documents or any other agreement related thereto or to the collection of the First-Lien Obligations or the valuation, use, protection or release of any security for the First-Lien Obligations, (ii) any election by any Applicable Authorized Representative or any holders of First-Lien Obligations, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or (iii) subject to Section 2.05, any borrowing by, or grant of a security interest or administrative expense priority under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as debtor-in-possession.

Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens granted to any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Parties on the Shared Collateral or of any Liens granted to any Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party on the Shared Collateral (or any actual or alleged defect in any of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the UCC, any applicable law, any Second Priority Debt Document or any Senior Debt Document or any other circumstance whatsoever, each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, hereby agrees that (a) any Lien on the Shared Collateral securing any Senior Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party or other agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Shared Collateral securing any Second Priority Debt Obligations and (b) any Lien on the Shared Collateral securing any Second Priority Debt Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Second Priority Representative, any Second Priority Debt Parties or any Second Priority Representative or other agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be junior and subordinate in all respects to all Liens on the Shared Collateral securing any Senior Obligations.
All Liens on the Shared Collateral securing any Senior Obligations shall be and remain senior in all respects and prior to all Liens on the Shared
Collateral securing any Second Priority Debt Obligations for all purposes, whether or not such Liens securing any Senior Obligations are subordinated to any Lien securing any other obligation of the Company, any Grantor or any other Person or otherwise subordinated, voided, avoided, invalidated or lapsed.
For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing subordination is also intended to apply to any judgment lien obtained by or on behalf of any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party.
2.02                           Nature of Senior Lender Claims.
Each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges that (a) a portion of the Senior Obligations is revolving in nature and that the amount thereof that may be outstanding at any time or from time to time may be increased or reduced and subsequently reborrowed, (b) the terms of the Senior Debt Documents and the Senior Obligations may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, and the Senior Obligations, or a portion thereof, may be Refinanced from time to time and (c) the aggregate amount of the Senior Obligations may be increased, in each case, without notice to or consent by the Second Priority Representatives or the Second Priority Debt Parties and without affecting the provisions hereof.
The Lien priorities provided for in Section 2.01 shall not be altered or otherwise affected by any amendment, supplement or other modification, or any Refinancing, of either the Senior Obligations or the Second Priority Debt Obligations, or any portion thereof.
As between the Company and the other Grantors and the Second Priority Debt Parties, the foregoing provisions will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company and the Grantors contained in any Second Priority Debt Document with respect to the incurrence of additional Senior Obligations.
2.03                           Prohibition on Contesting Liens.

The parties hereto agree that, so long as the Discharge of Senior Obligations has not occurred, (a) none of the Grantors shall grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property of any Grantor to secure any Second Priority Debt Obligation unless it has granted, or concurrently therewith grants, a Lien on such asset or property of such Grantor to secure each of the Senior Obligations; and (b) if any Second Priority Representative
To the extent that the foregoing are not complied with, any amounts received by any Second Priority Representative on account of such a lien shall be promptly remitted to the Designated Senior Representative.
2.05                           Perfection of Liens.
Except for the limited agreements of the Senior Representatives pursuant to Section 5.05 hereof, none of the Senior Representatives or the Senior Secured Parties shall be responsible for perfecting and maintaining the perfection of Liens with respect to the Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Second Priority Representatives or the Second Priority Debt Parties.
The provisions of this Agreement are intended solely to govern the respective Lien priorities as between the Senior Secured Parties and the Second Priority Debt Parties and shall not impose on the Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Second Priority Representatives, the Second Priority Debt Parties or any agent or trustee therefor any obligations in respect of the disposition of Proceeds of any Shared Collateral which would conflict with prior perfected claims therein in favor of any other Person or any order or decree of any court or governmental authority or any applicable law.
2.06                           Certain Cash Collateral.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Senior Debt Documents or Second Priority Debt Documents to the contrary, collateral consisting of cash and cash equivalents pledged to secure Credit Document Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or otherwise held by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.3(d), 5.3(a) or 11.13 of the Credit Agreement (or any equivalent successor provision) shall be applied as specified in the Credit Agreement and will not constitute Shared Collateral.

3.01                           Exercise of Remedies.
(a)  So long as the Discharge of Senior Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company or any other Grantor, (i) neither any Second Priority Representative nor any Second Priority Debt Party will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff) with respect to any Shared Collateral in respect of any Second Priority Debt Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought with respect to the Shared Collateral or any other Senior Collateral by any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party in respect of the Senior Obligations, the exercise of any right by any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party (or any agent or
sub-agent on their behalf) in respect of the Senior Obligations under any lockbox agreement, control agreement, landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral under the Senior Debt Documents or otherwise in respect of the Senior Collateral or the Senior Obligations, or (z) object to the forbearance by the Senior Secured Parties from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to the Shared Collateral in respect of Senior Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise provided herein, the Senior Representatives and the Senior Secured Parties shall have the exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff and the right to credit bid their debt) and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to the Shared Collateral without any consultation with or the consent of any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party; provided, however, that (A) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding commenced by or against the Company or any other Grantor, any Second Priority Representative may file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Second Priority Debt Obligations under its Second Priority Debt Facility, (B) any Second Priority Representative may take any action (not adverse to the prior Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the Senior Obligations or the rights of the Senior Representatives or the Senior Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof) in order to create, prove, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its rights in, and perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Shared Collateral, (C) any Second Priority Representative and the Second Priority Secured Parties may exercise their rights and remedies as unsecured creditors, as provided in Section 5.04, (D) any Second Priority Representative may exercise the rights and remedies provided for in Section 6.03 and (E) from and after the Second Priority Enforcement Date, the Major Second Priority Representative may exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff) with respect to any Shared Collateral in respect of any Second Priority Debt Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), but only so long as (1) the Designated Senior Representative has not commenced and is not diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) the Grantor which has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is not then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to ) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.
In exercising rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Collateral, the Senior Representatives and the Senior Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Senior Debt Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion.
Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise dispose of Shared Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction and of a secured creditor under Bankruptcy Laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless and
until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, except as expressly provided in the proviso in clause (ii) of Section 3.01(a), the sole right of the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties with respect to the Shared Collateral is to hold a Lien on the Shared Collateral in respect of Second Priority Debt Obligations pursuant to the Second Priority Debt Documents for the period and to the extent granted therein and to receive a share of the Proceeds thereof, if any, after the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred.

(d)                                 Each Second Priority Representative hereby acknowledges and agrees that no covenant, agreement or restriction contained in any Second Priority Debt Document shall be deemed to restrict in any way the rights and remedies of the Senior Representatives or the Senior Secured Parties with respect to the Senior Collateral as set forth in this Agreement and the Senior Debt Documents.
(e)                                  Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Designated Senior Representative shall have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Shared Collateral and shall have the exclusive right to determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto.
Following the Discharge of Senior Obligations, the Designated Second Priority Representative who may be instructed by the Second Priority Majority Representatives shall have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral, and the Designated Second Priority Representative who may be instructed by the Second Priority Majority Representatives shall have the exclusive right to direct the time, method and place of exercising or conducting any proceeding for the exercise of any right or remedy available to the Second Priority Debt Parties with respect to the Collateral, or of exercising or directing the exercise of any trust or power conferred on the Second Priority Representatives, or for the taking of any other action authorized by the Second Priority Collateral Documents; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Second Priority Representative or other agent or trustee acting on behalf of the Second Priority Debt Parties to take such actions with respect to the Collateral after the Discharge of Senior Obligations as may be otherwise required or authorized pursuant to any intercreditor agreement governing the Second Priority Debt Parties or the Second Priority Debt Obligations.
3.02                           Cooperation.
Subject to the proviso in clause (ii) of Section 3.01(a), each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that, unless and until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, it will not commence, or join with any Person (other than the Senior Secured Parties and the Senior Representatives upon the request of the Designated Senior Representative) in commencing, any enforcement, collection, execution, levy or foreclosure action or proceeding with respect to any Lien held by it in the Shared Collateral under any of the Second Priority Debt Documents or otherwise in respect of the Second Priority Debt Obligations.
3.03                           Actions upon Breach.
Should any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party, contrary to this Agreement, in any way take, attempt to take or threaten to take any action with respect to the Shared Collateral (including any attempt to realize upon or enforce any remedy with respect to this Agreement) or fail to take any action required by this Agreement, any Senior Representative or other Senior Secured Party (in its or their own name or in the name of the Company or any other Grantor) or the Company may obtain relief against such Second Priority Representative or such Second Priority Debt Party by injunction, specific performance or other appropriate equitable relief.
Each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Facility, hereby (i) agrees that the Senior Secured Parties’ damages from the actions of the Second Priority Representatives or any Second Priority Debt Party may at that time be difficult to ascertain and may be irreparable and waives any defense that the Company, any other Grantor or the Senior Secured Parties cannot demonstrate damage or be made whole by the awarding of damages and (ii) irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law and any other defense that might be asserted to bar the remedy of specific performance in any action that may be brought by any Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party.

In addition, if in connection with any such release by the Senior Obligations the guarantee by any Guarantor of Senior Obligations is released, such Guarantor shall also be released from its guarantee of any Second Priority Debt Obligations.

Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that each Second Priority Collateral Document under its Second Priority Debt Facility shall include the following language (or language to similar effect reasonably approved by the Designated Senior Representative):
“Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the liens and security interests granted to the [Second Priority Representative] pursuant to this Agreement are expressly subject and subordinate to the liens and security interests granted in favor of the Senior Secured Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement referred to below), including liens and security interests granted to Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent, pursuant to or in connection with the Credit Agreement, dated as of February [·], 2011, among the Company, Holdings, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as Administrative Agent and the other parties thereto, as amended, restated, amended and restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, and (ii) the exercise of any right or remedy by the [Second Priority Representative] hereunder is subject to the limitations and provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement dated as of [ ], 20[ ] (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Intercreditor Agreement”), among Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Is lands Branch, as Administrative Agent, [      ] and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities party thereto.
In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern.”
In the event that each applicable Senior Representative and/or the Senior Secured Parties enter into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the Senior Collateral Documents for the purpose of adding to or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any Senior Collateral Document or changing in any manner the rights of the Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Company or any other Grantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens in Senior Collateral) in a manner that is applicable

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties may exercise rights and remedies as unsecured creditors against the Company and any other Grantor in accordance with the terms of the Second Priority Debt Documents and applicable law so long as such rights and remedies do not violate any express provision of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the receipt by any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party of the required payments of principal, premium, interest, fees and other amounts due under the Second Priority Debt Documents so long as such receipt is not the direct or indirect result of the exercise by a Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party of rights or remedies as a secured creditor in respect of Shared Collateral.
In the event any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party becomes a judgment lien creditor in respect of Shared Collateral as a result of its enforcement of its rights as an unsecured creditor in respect of Second Priority Debt Obligations, such judgment lien shall be subordinated to the Liens securing Senior Obligations on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Priority Debt Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens securing Senior Obligations under this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement shall impair or otherwise adversely affect any rights or remedies the Senior Representatives or the Senior Secured Parties may have with respect to the Senior Collateral.
5.05                           Gratuitous Bailee for Perfection.
Each Senior Representative acknowledges and agrees that if it shall at any time hold a Lien securing any Senior Obligations on any Shared Collateral that can be perfected by the possession or control of such Shared Collateral or of any account in which such Shared Collateral is held, and if such Shared Collateral or any such account is in fact in the possession or under the control of such Senior Representative, or of agents or bailees of such Person (such Shared Collateral being referred to herein as the “Pledged or Controlled Collateral”), or if it shall any time obtain any landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights or access to Shared Collateral, the applicable Senior Representative shall also hold such Pledged or Controlled Collateral, or take such actions with respect to such landlord waiver, bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement, as sub-agent or gratuitous bailee for the relevant Second Priority Representatives, in each case solely for the purpose of perfecting the Liens granted under the relevant Second Priority Collateral Documents and subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.05.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, the Senior Representatives and the Senior Secured Parties shall be entitled to deal with the Pledged or Controlled Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Senior Debt Documents as if the Liens under the Second Priority Collateral Documents did not exist.
The rights of the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties with
respect to the Pledged or Controlled Collateral shall at all times be subject to the terms of this Agreement.
The Senior Representatives and the Senior Secured Parties shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Second Priority Representatives or any Second Priority Debt Party to assure that any of the Pledged or Controlled Collateral is genuine or owned by the Grantors or to protect or preserve rights or benefits of any Person or any rights pertaining to the Shared Collateral, except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.05.
The duties or responsibilities of the Senior Representatives under this Section 5.05 shall be limited solely to holding or controlling the Shared Collateral and the related Liens referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.05 as sub-agent and gratuitous bailee for the relevant Second Priority Representative for purposes of perfecting the Lien held by such Second Priority Representative.
The Senior Representatives shall not have by reason of the Second Priority Collateral Documents or this Agreement, or any other document, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party, and each, Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, hereby waives and releases the Senior Representatives from all claims and liabilities arising pursuant to the Senior Representatives’ roles under this Section 5.05 as sub-agents and gratuitous bailees with respect to the Shared Collateral.
The Company and the other Grantors shall take such further action as is required to effectuate the transfer contemplated hereby and shall indemnify each Senior Representative for loss or damage suffered by such Senior Representative as a result of such transfer, except for loss or damage suffered by any such Person as a result of its own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith.
The Senior Representatives have no obligations to follow instructions from any Second Priority Representative or any other Second Priority Debt Party in contravention of this Agreement.
None of the Senior Representatives nor any of the other Senior Secured Parties shall be required to marshal any present or future collateral security for any obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party under the Senior Debt Documents or any assurance of payment in respect thereof, or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of their rights in
respect of such collateral security or any assurance of payment in respect thereof shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising.
If, at any time after the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, the Company or any Subsidiary incurs any Senior Obligations (other than in respect of the payment of indemnities surviving the Discharge of Senior Obligations), then such Discharge of Senior Obligations shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to any actions taken prior to the date of such designation as a result of the occurrence of such first Discharge of Senior Obligations) and the applicable agreement governing such Senior Obligations shall automatically be treated as a Senior Debt Document for all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Shared Collateral set forth herein and the agent, representative or trustee for the holders of such Senior Obligations shall be the Senior Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.
SECTION 6                                   Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings
6.01                           Financing Issues.
Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, if the Company or any other Grantor shall be subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (a) if any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party shall desire to consent (or not object) to the sale, use or lease of cash or other collateral or to consent (or not object) to the Company’s or any other Grantor’s obtaining financing under Section 363 or Section 364 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law (“DIP Financing”), then each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that it will raise no objection to and will not otherwise contest such sale, use or lease of such cash or other collateral or such DIP Financing and, except to the extent permitted by Section 6.03, will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith and, to the extent the Liens securing any Senior Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have subordinated) its Liens in the Shared Collateral to (x) any
and all Liens securing such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the Liens securing the Second Priority Debt Obligations are so subordinated to Liens securing Senior Obligations under this Agreement and (y) to any “carve-out” for professional and United States Trustee fees and any other customary expenses agreed to by the Senior Representatives, (b) each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that it will raise no objection to (and will not otherwise contest (i) any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of Senior Obligations made by any Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party, ii) any lawful exercise by any Senior Secured Party of the right to credit bid Senior Obligations at any sale in foreclosure of Senior Collateral, (iii) any other request for judicial relief made in any court by any Senior Secured Party relating to the lawful enforcement of any Lien on Senior Collateral or iv) any motion or order relating to a sale or other disposition of assets of any Grantor for which any Senior Representative has consented that provides, to the extent such sale or other disposition is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the Senior Obligations and the Second Priority Debt Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the Senior Obligations rank to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the Second Priority Debt Obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that notice received two Business Days prior to the entry of an order approving such usage of cash or other collateral or approving such DIP Financing as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be adequate notice.
6.02                           Relief from the Automatic Stay.
Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that none of them shall seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or take any action in derogation thereof, in each case in respect of any Shared Collateral, without the prior written consent of the Designated Senior Representative.
6.03                           Adequate Protection.
Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that none of them shall (A) object, contest or support any other Person objecting to or contesting (a) any request by any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Parties for adequate protection, (b) any objection by any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on any Senior Representative’s or Senior Secured Party’s claiming a lack of adequate protection or (c) the payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts of any Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party under Section 506(b) of Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law or (B) assert or support any claim for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral under Section 506(c) of Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.03 or in Section 6.01, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (i) if the Senior Secured Parties (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of additional collateral or superpriority claims in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or 364 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, then each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party
under its Second Priority Debt Facility, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a replacement Lien or superpriority claim on such additional collateral, which Lien or superpriority claim shall be subordinated to the Liens securing all Senior Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Priority Debt Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens securing Senior Obligations under this Agreement and (ii) in the event any Second Priority Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the Second Priority Debt Parties under their Second Priority Debt Facilities, seek or request adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of additional collateral, then such Second Priority Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under their Second Priority Debt Facilities, agree that it will not contest, object to or support any Person in contesting or objecting to any request by a Senior Representative for adequate protection in the form of a senior Lien on such additional collateral as security for the Senior Obligations and any such DIP Financing and that any Lien on such additional collateral securing the Second Priority Debt Obligations shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing the Senior Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and any other Liens granted to the Senior Secured Parties as adequate protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Priority Debt Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens securing Senior Obligations under this Agreement.
Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that notwithstanding the foregoing, any administrative or superpriority claim granted by way of adequate protection may be treated as part of such Second Priority Debt Party’s prepetition claim for purposes of section 1129(a)(9) of the Title 11 of the United States Code and the Company shall not be required under such section to pay such claim in cash.
6.04                           Preference Issues.
If any Senior Secured Party is required in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay any amount to the estate of the Company or any other Grantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar Person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise, then the Senior Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the Senior Secured Parties shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement until a Discharge of Senior Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts.
Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, hereby agrees that none of them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with this Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in this Agreement.
6.05                           Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classifications.
Each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its
Second Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges and agrees that (a) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Senior Collateral Documents and the Second Priority Collateral Documents constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Shared Collateral, the Second Priority Debt Obligations are fundamentally different from the Senior Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization proposed or adopted in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.
To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that any claims of the Senior Secured Parties and the Second Priority Debt Parties in respect of the Shared Collateral constitute a single class of claims (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, hereby acknowledges and agrees that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Grantors in respect of the Shared Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Shared Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Second Priority Debt Parties), the Senior Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest (whether or not allowed or allowable) before any distribution is made in respect of the Second Priority Debt Obligations, with each Second Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Designated Senior Representative amounts otherwise received or receivable by them to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Second Priority Debt Parties.
6.06                           Post-Petition Interest.
(a)  Neither any Second Priority Representative nor any Second Priority Debt Party shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Senior Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of any Senior Secured Party’s Lien, without regard to the existence of the Lien of any Second Priority Representative on behalf of any Second Priority Debt Party on the Collateral.
(b)                                 Neither any Senior Representative nor any other Senior Secured Party shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Second Lien Collateral Agent or any Second Priority Debt Party for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Second Lien Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of the Lien of the Second Priority Representatives on behalf of the Second Priority Debt Parties on the Collateral (after taking into account the value of the Senior Obligations).
6.07                           No Waivers of Rights of Senior Secured Parties.
Nothing contained herein shall, except as expressly provided herein, prohibit or in any way limit any Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party from objecting in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise to any action taken by any Second Priority Debt Party, including the seeking by any Second Priority Debt Party of adequate protection or the asserting by any Second Priority Debt Party of any of its rights and remedies under the Second Priority Debt Documents or otherwise.
6.08                           Application.
This Agreement, which the parties hereto expressly acknowledge is a “subordination agreement” under Section 510(a) of Title 11 of the United
States Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, shall be effective before, during and after the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.
The relative rights as to the Shared Collateral and proceeds thereof shall continue after the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of the petition therefor, subject to any court order approving the financing of, or use of cash collateral by, any Grantor.
All references herein to any Grantor shall include such Grantor as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such Grantor.
6.09                           Other Matters.
To the extent that any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party has or acquires rights under Section 363 or Section 364 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law with respect to any of the Shared Collateral, such Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees not to assert any such rights without the prior written consent of each Senior Representative, provided that if requested by any Senior Representative, such Second Priority Representative shall timely exercise such rights in the manner requested by the Senior Representatives (acting unanimously), including any rights to payments in respect of such rights.
Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the Senior Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Shared Collateral.
6.11                           Reorganization Securities.
If, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed, pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, on account of both the Senior Obligations and the Second Priority Debt Obligations (including without limitation any administrative or superpriority claim granted as adequate protection), then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the Senior Obligations and on account of the Second Priority Debt Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same assets or property, the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations.
SECTION 7                                   Reliance; Etc.
7.01                           Reliance.
The consent by the Senior Secured Parties to the execution and delivery of the Second Priority Debt Documents to which the Senior Secured Par-ties have consented and all loans and other extensions of credit made or deemed made on and after the date hereof by the Senior Secured Parties to the Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed to have been given and made in reliance upon this Agreement.
Each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges that it and such Second Priority Debt Parties have, independently and without reliance on any Senior Representative or other Senior Secured Party, and based on documents and information deemed by them appropriate, made their own credit analysis and
decision to enter into the Second Priority Debt Documents to which they are party or by which they are bound, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and they will continue to make their own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under the Second Priority Debt Documents or this Agreement.

Each Second Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Second Priority Debt Party under its Second Priority Debt Facility, acknowledges and agrees that neither any Senior Representative nor any other Senior Secured Party has made any express or implied representation or warranty, including with respect to the execution, validity, legality, completeness, collectibility or enforceability of any of the Senior Debt Documents, the ownership of any Shared Collateral or the perfection or priority of any Liens thereon.
The Senior Secured Parties will be entitled to manage and supervise their respective loans and extensions of credit under the Senior Debt Documents in accordance with law and as they may otherwise, in their sole discretion, deem appropriate, and the Senior Secured Parties may manage their loans and extensions of credit without regard to any rights or interests that the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties have in the Shared Collateral or otherwise, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
Neither any Senior Representative nor any other Senior Secured Party shall have any duty to any Second Priority Representative or Second Priority Debt Party to act or refrain from acting in a manner that allows, or results in, the occurrence or continuance of an event of default or default under any agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary (including the Second Priority Debt Documents), regardless of any knowledge thereof that they may have or be charged with.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties have not otherwise made to each other, nor do they hereby make to each other, any warranties, express or implied, nor do they assume any liability to each other with respect to (a) the enforceability, validity, value or collectibility of any of the Senior Obligations, the Second Priority Debt Obligations or any guarantee or security which may have been granted to any of them in connection therewith, (b) any Grantor’s title to or right to transfer any of the Shared Collateral or (c) any other matter except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
7.03                           Obligations Unconditional.
All rights, interests, agreements and obligations of the Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties hereunder shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:

(d)                                 the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in respect of the Company or any other Grantor; or
(e)                                  any other circumstances that otherwise might constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, (i) the Company or any other Grantor in respect of the Senior Obligations or (ii) any Second Priority Representative or Second Priority Debt Party in respect of this Agreement.

The terms of this Agreement shall survive and continue in full force and effect in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

(a)                                  No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

Any such amendment, supplement or waiver shall be in writing and shall be binding upon the Senior Se-cured Parties and the Second Priority Debt Parties and their respective successors and assigns.
(c)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Secured Party, any Representative may become a party hereto by execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement in accordance with Section 8.09 of this Agreement and upon such execution and delivery, such Representative and the Secured Parties and Senior Obligations or Second Priority Debt Obligations of the Debt Facility for which such Representative is acting shall be subject to the terms hereof.

The Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Secured Parties shall have no duty to advise any other party hereunder of information known to it or them regarding such condition or any such circumstances or otherwise.
In the event that any Senior Representative, any Senior Secured Party, any Second Priority Representative or any Second Priority Debt Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to any other party, it shall be under no obligation to (i) make, and the Senior Representatives, the Senior Secured Parties, the Second Priority Representatives and the Second Priority Debt Parties shall not make or be deemed to have made, any express or implied representation or warranty, including with respect to the accuracy, completeness, truthfulness or validity of any such information so provided, (ii) provide any additional information or to provide any such information on any subsequent occasion, (iii) undertake any investigation or (iv) disclose any information that, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance practices, such party wishes to maintain confidential or is otherwise required to maintain confidential.

The rights and obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Grantor as a party to this Agreement.

Any such additional class or series of Second Priority Debt (the “Second Priority Class Debt”) may be secured by a second priority, subordinated Lien on Shared Collateral, in each case under and pursuant to the relevant Second Priority Collateral Documents for such Second Priority Class Debt, if and subject to the condition that the Representative of any such Second Priority Class Debt (each, a “Second Priority Class Debt Representative”), acting on behalf of the holders of such Second Priority Class Debt (such Representative and holders in respect of any Second Priority Class Debt being referred to as the “Second Priority Class Debt Parties”), becomes a party to this Agreement by satisfying conditions (i) through (iii), as applicable, of the immediately succeeding paragraph.
Any such additional class or series of Senior Facilities (the “Senior Class Debt”; and the Senior Class Debt and Second Priority Class Debt, collectively, the “Class Debt”) may be secured by a senior Lien on Shared Collateral, in each case under and pursuant to the Senior Collateral
Documents, if and subject to the condition that the Representative of any such Senior Class Debt (each, a “Senior Class Debt Representative”; and the Senior Class Debt Representatives and Second Priority Class Debt Representatives, collectively, the “Class Debt Representatives”), acting on behalf of the holders of such Senior Class Debt (such Representative and holders in respect of any such Senior Class Debt being referred to as the “Senior Class Debt Parties; and the Senior Class Debt Parties and Second Priority Class Debt Parties, collectively, the “Class Debt Parties”), becomes a party to this Agreement by satisfying the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii), as applicable, of the immediately succeeding paragraph.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any Receivables (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Security Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Receivables (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

5.5  Code and Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the NY UCC or any other applicable law or in equity and also may without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange broker’s board or at any of the Administrative Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such price or prices and upon such other terms as are commercially reasonable irrespective of the impact of any such sales on the market price of the Collateral.
Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal that it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
The Administrative Agent or any Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale, and, to the extent permitted by
13

The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.
To the extent permitted by law, each Grantor hereby waives any claim against the Administrative Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree.
The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 5.5 in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.4.

5.7  Amendments, etc.
with Respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights.
Each Grantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding, without any reservation of rights against any Grantor and without notice to or further assent by any Grantor, (a) that any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may be rescinded by such party and any of the Obligations continued, (b) that the Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, (c) that the Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents, the Letters of Credit and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith and the Hedge Agreements and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith and any documents entered into with the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with treasury, depositary or cash management services or in connection with any automated clearinghouse transfer of funds may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, or, in the case of any Hedge Agreement or documents entered into with the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with treasury, depositary or cash management services or in connection with any automated clearinghouse transfer of funds, the party thereto) may deem advisable from time to time, and (d) that any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as
14
security for the Obligations or for this Security Agreement or any property subject thereto.
When making any demand hereunder against any Grantor, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any Grantor or grantor, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any Grantor or grantor or any release of the Borrower or any Grantor or grantor shall not relieve any Grantor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any Grantor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party against any Grantor.

(x)            defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral (with such Grantor’s consent to the extent such action or its resolution could materially affect such Grantor or any of its Affiliates in any manner other than with respect to its continuing rights in such Collateral);
(xi)           settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate (with such Grantor’s consent to the extent such action or its resolution could materially affect such Grantor or any of its Affiliates in any manner other than with respect to its continuing rights in such Collateral);

(xiii)         generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent’s option and such Grantor’s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things that the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Administrative Agent’s and the Secured Parties’ Security Interests therein and to effect the intent of this Security Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.
16

6.2           Duty of Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent’s sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the NY UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own account.
The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property.
Neither the Administrative Agent, any Secured Party nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof.
The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agent’s and the Secured Parties’ interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to exercise any such powers.
The Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
6.3           Authority of Administrative Agent.
Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Security Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Security Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority
17
so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.
6.4           Security Interest Absolute.
All rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the security interest and all obligations of the Grantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional.
6.5           Continuing Security Interest; Assignments Under the Credit Agreement; Release.
(a) This Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Grantor and the successors and assigns thereof and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns until all Obligations under the Credit Documents and the obligations of each Grantor under this Security Agreement shall have been satisfied by payment in full, the Commitments shall be terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement and any Hedge Agreement the Credit Parties may be free from any Obligations.
(b)           A Subsidiary Grantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder and the Security Interest in the Collateral of such Subsidiary Grantor shall be automatically released upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Grantor ceases to be a Domestic Subsidiary of the Borrower.
(c)           Upon any sale or other transfer by any Grantor of any Collateral that is permitted under the Credit Agreement, or upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security interest granted hereby in any Collateral pursuant to Section 13.1 of the Credit Agreement, the Security Interest in such Collateral shall be automatically released and such Collateral sold free and clear of the Lien and Security Interests created hereby.
Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
6.6           Reinstatement.
This Security Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any other Credit Party, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any other Credit Party or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

After any retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Security Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Security Agreement while it was Administrative Agent hereunder.
(c)           The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have any duty whatsoever with respect to any Secured Party that is a counterparty to a Hedge Agreement the obligations under which constitute Obligations, until it shall have received written notice in form
