If, within the time period required under the terms of this Section 2.6, the Administrative Agent does not receive a Notice of Conversion or Continuation from the Borrower containing a permitted election to continue any Eurocurrency Loans for an additional Interest Period or to convert any such Loans, then, upon the expiration of the Interest Period therefor, such Loans will be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans or, in the case of non-Dollar denominated Revolving Loans, Eurocurrency Loans with an Interest Period of one month.

If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender on the date of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent
If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and, if so notified, the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent.

In the event that (1) the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the applicable Facing Agent as provided in Section 2.9(c) in an amount equal to the amount of any drawing honored by the applicable Facing Agent under a Letter of Credit issued by it in accordance with the terms hereof, or (2) any Bank Guarantee shall remain outstanding on the Revolver Termination Date, the applicable Facing Agent shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender, of the unreimbursed amount of such drawing or the amount of such Bank Guarantee, as applicable, and of such Lender’s respective participation therein.

The applicable Facing Agent or any Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.9(i), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall include a certificate submitted to the Borrower by the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender, although failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish the Borrower’s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9(i); provided, however, if the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender, as applicable, has intentionally withheld or delayed such notice, the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall not be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9(i) for periods occurring prior to the 180th day before the giving of such notice.

Each such Notice of Revolving Commitment Increase shall specify (i) the proposed Revolving Commitment Increase Date, which date shall be no earlier than five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Administrative Agent of such Notice of Revolving Commitment Increase, (ii) the amount of the requested Revolving Commitment Increase, (iii) as applicable, the identity of each New Revolving Lender and Revolving Lender that has agreed in writing to increase its Revolving Commitment hereunder, and (iv) the amount of the respective Revolving Commitments of the then existing Revolving Lenders and the New Revolving Lenders from and after the Revolving Commitment Increase Date.
(d)                                 Each Revolving Commitment Increase shall become effective on its Revolving Commitment Increase Date and upon such effectiveness: (i) the Administrative Agent shall record in the register each then New Revolving Lender’s information as provided in the applicable Notice of Commitment Increase and pursuant to an administrative questionnaire that shall be executed and delivered by each New Revolving Lender to the Administrative Agent on or before such Revolving Commitment Increase Date, (ii) Schedule 1.1(a) hereof shall be amended and restated to set forth all Revolving Lenders (including any New Revolving Lenders) that will be Revolving Lenders hereunder after giving effect to such Revolving Commitment Increase (which amended and restated Schedule 1.1(a) shall be set forth in Annex I to the applicable Notice of Revolving Commitment Increase) and the Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Revolving Lender (including each New Revolving Lender) a copy of such amended and restated Schedule 1.1(a), and (iii) each New Revolving Lender identified on the Notice of Revolving Commitment Increase for such Revolving Commitment Increase shall be a “Lender” and a “Revolving Lender” for all purposes under this Agreement.
(e)                                  As a condition precedent to any Revolving Commitment Increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower dated as of the Revolving Commitment Increase Date signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such Revolving Commitment Increase and certifying that, before and after giving effect to such Revolving Commitment Increase, (i) the representations and warranties contained in Article VI made by it are true and correct on and as of the Revolving Commitment Increase Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date and (ii) no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists or will exist as of the Revolving Commitment Increase Date.
(a)                                 At any time and from time to time, the Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Lenders), request an extension of the Non-Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date then in effect (such existing Non-Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date, the “Existing Non-Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date”) to the Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date and change the Applicable Base Rate Margin, Applicable Eurocurrency Margin, amortization and/or fees payable with respect to such Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans of the Lenders that so consent to such extension (such changes in maturity and other terms, the “Proposed Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes”).
Within 10 Business Days of delivery of such notice (or such other period as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall mutually agree upon), each Non-Extended Term B Dollar Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent whether or not it consents to the Proposed Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes (which consent may be given or withheld in such Lender’s sole and absolute discretion).
The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Lenders of the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Lenders’ responses.
The Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall promptly confirm to the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Lenders the Proposed Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes and the effective date for such changes (the “Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans Extension Effective Date”) to the Consenting Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans.
As a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the Proposed Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (i) a certificate of the Borrower dated as of the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans Extension Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such extension (and to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent (acting reasonably) the Borrower and the Guarantors shall provide any other certifications or copies of instruments of a substantially similar nature to those that were provided in the “secretary’s certificate” or the reaffirmation agreement delivered on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date) and certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension, the representations and warranties contained in Article VI made by it are true and correct on and as of the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans Extension Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, and no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists or will exist as of the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans Extension Effective Date and (ii) if requested by the Administrative Agent, a legal opinion reasonably satisfactory to it.
(a)                                 After the Eleventh Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower may at any time or from time to time, by notice to the Administrative Agent, request (x) one or more incremental senior secured term facilities on the terms set forth below (the “Incremental Term Facilities” and the term loans made thereunder, the “Incremental Term Loans”) and/or (y) one or more incremental senior secured revolving facilities on the terms set forth below (the “Incremental Revolving Facilities” and the revolving loans and other extensions of credit made thereunder, the “Incremental Revolving Loans;” the Incremental Revolving Facilities, together with the Incremental Term Facilities, the “Incremental Facilities;” the Incremental Revolving Loans, together with the Incremental Term Loans, the “Incremental Loans”).
(e)                                  Upon each increase in the Revolving Commitments pursuant to an Incremental Revolving Facility, (i) each Revolving Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each lender providing a portion of the Incremental Revolving Facility (each an “Incremental Revolving Facility Lender”) in respect of such increase, and each such Incremental Revolving Facility Lender will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed, a portion of such Revolving Lender’s participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans such that, after giving effect to each such deemed assignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding (A) participations hereunder in Letters of Credit and (B) participations hereunder in Swing Line Loans held by each Revolving Lender and (ii) the Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders shall make such Revolving Loans, and the other Revolving Lenders shall receive such prepayments, as the Administrative Agent shall direct, to cause the Revolving Loans to be made ratably by all the Revolving Lenders immediately after giving effect to such Incremental Revolving Facility.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Refinancing Amendment.
(e)                                  In connection with any New Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business Days’ (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably, to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.15.
The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans for any Interest Period, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders thereof.
Unless otherwise specified, accrued Commitment Fees shall be due and payable (i) on each Quarterly Payment Date occurring after the Closing Date, (ii) on the Revolver Termination Date and (iii) upon any reduction or termination in whole or in part of the Revolving Commitments, as the case may be (but only, in the case of a reduction, on the portion of the Revolving Commitments then being reduced).
The Administrative Agent shall, at any time and from time to time upon request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans pursuant to this Agreement.
At the time it gives any Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion or Continuation with respect to any Borrowing bearing interest with reference to the Eurocurrency Rate, the Borrower shall elect, by giving the Administrative Agent written notice, the interest period (each an “Interest Period”) applicable thereto, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower, be one, two, three or six months or, if available or otherwise satisfactory to each of the applicable Lenders (as determined by each such applicable Lender in its sole discretion) a twelve month period, provided that:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (i) with respect to Term B Dollar Loans, the Borrower may only have Base Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Loans with a one month Interest Period for the first 30 days after the Third Amendment Effective Date or, if earlier, the date on which the Administrative Agent informs the Borrower of the completion of the syndication of the Existing Term B Dollar Loans and (ii) if requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, in its discretion, may offer Interest Periods shorter than one month.
then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders).
At any time that any Eurocurrency Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 3.6(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section 3.6(a)(iii), shall) either (i) if the affected Eurocurrency Loan has not yet been made or the conversion to such Eurocurrency Loan has not yet been accomplished, by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the same date that the Borrower was notified by the affected Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.6(a)(ii) or (iii), cancel the respective Borrowing, or (ii) if the affected Eurocurrency Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days’ written notice to Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert such Eurocurrency Loan into a Base Rate Loan, provided, that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 3.6(b).
Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 3.6(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts; provided that no Lender shall be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.6(c) for increased costs incurred prior to the 180th day before the giving of such notice, unless such increased costs are due to a change in law that provides for retroactive effect, in which case the 180 day period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect.
(ii)                                  to the extent that any portion (the “unreallocated portion”) of the Pro Rata Share of such Impaired Lender with respect to any LC Obligations and any outstanding Swing Line Loans cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of clause (i) above or otherwise, the Borrower will, not later than 10 Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of any Facing Agent and/or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be), (A) Cash Collateralize the obligations of the Borrower to any Facing Agent in respect of such LC Obligations in an amount at least equal to 105% of the aggregate amount of the unreallocated portion of such LC Obligations, or (B) in the case of such outstanding Swing Line Loans, prepay the unreallocated portion thereof, or (C) make other arrangements satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and to the applicable Facing Agent and the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, in their sole discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Impaired Lender; and
If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, each Facing Agent and the Swing Line Lender agree in writing in their discretion that a Revolving Lender that is an Impaired Lender should no longer be deemed to be an Impaired Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice, such Revolving Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase such portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the other Revolving Lenders (or the other Revolving Lenders will purchase from the formerly Impaired Lender) and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably determine to be necessary to cause such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share to be on a pro rata basis in accordance with its Revolving Commitment, whereupon such Revolving Lender will cease to be an Impaired Lender and will be a Non-Impaired Lender; provided, that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Revolving Lender was an Impaired Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Impaired Lender to Non-Impaired Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Revolving Lender having been an Impaired Lender.
(a)                                 The Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Revolving Loans, any of the Term Loans or the Swing Line Loans in any combination, in whole or in part, from time to time, without premium or penalty except as set forth in Section 4.5(c) and Section 4.5(e) on the following terms and conditions: (i) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice at its Notice Office (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay the Loans, whether such Loans are Term Loans, Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans, the amount of such prepayment and the specific Borrowings to which such prepayment is to be applied, which notice shall be given by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent by 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three Business Days prior in the case of Eurocurrency Loans and at least one Business Day prior in the case of Base Rate Loans to the date of such prepayment and which notice shall (except in the case of Swing Line Loans) promptly be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to each of the applicable Lenders; (ii) each partial prepayment of any Borrowing (other than a Borrowing of Swing Line Loans) shall be in an aggregate Dollar Equivalent principal amount of at least $5,000,000 (or, in connection with any Refinancing Amendment, at least $1,000,000) and each partial prepayment of a Swing Line Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $500,000; provided, that any partial prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing that reduces the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto shall be subject to the ante-penultimate sentence of Section 4.5(a)(i); (iii) Eurocurrency Loans may be prepaid pursuant to this Section 4.3 on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or subject to Section 3.5 on any other day; (iv) except as may otherwise be set forth in any Refinancing Amendment, New Extension Offer or Incremental Amendment in accordance with the terms of Sections 2.13, 2,14 or 2.15, respectively, each prepayment in respect of any Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among the Loans comprising such Borrowing; provided, that such prepayment shall not be applied to any Revolving Loans of an Impaired Lender at any time when the aggregate amount of
(b)                                 In the event of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in Section 12.1(b), the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), to repay all Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, fees and all other amounts due and owing to such Lender in accordance with said Section 12.1(b), so long as (A) in the case of the repayment of Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender pursuant to this clause (b), the Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender is terminated concurrently with such repayment pursuant to Section 4.1(b) and (B) in the case of the repayment of Loans of any Lender, the consents required by Section 12.1(b) in connection with the repayment pursuant to this clause (b) shall have been obtained.
(i)                                     The Borrower shall have the right to make a voluntary prepayment of Term Loans at a discount to par pursuant to a Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers or Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers (any such prepayment, the “Discounted Loan Prepayment”), in each case made in accordance with this Section 4.3(c); provided that the Borrower shall not initiate any action under this Section 4.3(c) in order to make a Discounted Loan Prepayment unless (I) at least ten (10) Business Days shall have passed since the consummation of the most recent Discounted Loan Prepayment as a result of a prepayment made by the Borrower on the applicable Discounted Prepayment Effective Date; or (II) at least three (3) Business Days shall have passed since the date the Borrower was notified that no Lender was willing to accept any prepayment of any Term Loan at the Specified Discount, within the Discount Range or at any discount to par value, as applicable, or in the case of Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, the date of the Borrower’s election not to accept any Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers.
