5
“Company Material Adverse Effect” means any change, event or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on (x) the business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Joint Venture Entities (as each such capitalized term is defined in the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014), taken as a whole, or (y) the ability of the Company to consummate or timely perform the Merger (as defined in the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014) or any of the transactions contemplated thereby; provided, however, that in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect in the case of clause (x) above, any change, event or occurrence principally attributable to, arising out of, or resulting from any of the following shall be disregarded:  (i) general economic, business, industry or credit, financial or capital market conditions (whether in the United States or internationally), including conditions affecting generally the industries served by the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the taking of any action specifically required by the Haas Merger Agreement or the Related Agreements (as each such capitalized term is defined in the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014) (other than actions required pursuant to Section 5.2 of the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014), (iii) except with respect to Section 3.4 of the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014, the negotiation, entry into, and announcement of the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014 or pendency of the Merger, including any suit, action or proceeding in connection with the Merger, (iv) the breach of the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014 or any Related Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub (as each such capitalized term is defined in the Haas Merger Agreement as in effect on January 30, 2014), (v) the taking of any action with the written approval of Parent, (vi) pandemics, earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, floods and acts of God, (vii) acts of war (whether declared or not declared), sabotage, terrorism, military actions or the escalation thereof, (viii) any changes or prospective changes in applicable Laws or accounting rules, including GAAP or interpretations thereof, or any changes or prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, or any changes in general legal, regulatory or political conditions, and (ix) the failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to meet any projections, estimates or budgets for any period prior to, on or after January 30, 2014; provided, that any disproportionate effect resulting from any change, event or occurrence referred to in clauses (i) or (viii) shall be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred to the extent that such change, event or occurrence has a materially disproportionate and adverse effect on the Company and/or its Subsidiaries compared to other participants in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.
(h)                                 Refinancing.
The Agent shall have received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that, substantially simultaneously with the borrowing of the Tranche B Term Loans, all existing third party indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and its

(i)                                     Historical Financial Statements.
(j)                                    Pro Forma Financial Statements.

(k)                                 Acquisition.
The Acquisition shall have been consummated, or substantially simultaneously with the initial borrowing under the Tranche B Term Loans shall be consummated, in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the Haas Merger Agreement without giving effect to any modifications, amendments, consents or waivers thereto that are material and adverse to the Lenders or the First Amendment Lead Arrangers without the prior written consent of the First Amendment Lead Arrangers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
(l)                                     Specified Representations.
After giving effect to the Transactions, the Specified Merger Agreement Representations and the Specified Representations shall be true and correct.
“Specified Merger Agreement Representations” means such of the representations made by the Company with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries in the Haas Merger Agreement as are material to the interests of the Lenders, but only to the extent that the Borrower (or its affiliates) has the right to terminate its (or its affiliates’) obligations under the Haas Merger Agreement or decline to consummate the Acquisition as a result of a breach of such representations in the Haas Merger Agreement.

7
(m)                             Additional Collateral.
The Security Documents shall be in full force and effect on the First Amendment Effective Date, and, in the case of assets of Existing Guarantors, the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties shall have a security interest in the Collateral of the type and priority described in each Security Document.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that any security interest in any Collateral held by the Company and each Company Subsidiary Guarantor that is not or cannot be provided and/or perfected on the First Amendment Effective Date (other than the pledge and perfection of the security interests in the certificated equity interests of the Company and, to the extent held by any Company Subsidiary Guarantor, each Company Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case to the extent received from Haas Group Inc. after commercially reasonable efforts to obtain them on the Amendment Effective Date) and other assets pursuant to which a lien may be perfected solely by the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code or a customary “short form” intellectual property filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office (with respect to such intellectual property filings, solely to the extent such filings can be provided and/or perfected after the Borrower’s use of commercially reasonable efforts to do so) after the Borrower’s use of commercially reasonable efforts to do so or without undue burden or expense, then the provision and/or perfection of a security interest in such Collateral shall not constitute a condition to the First Amendment Effective Date, but instead shall be required to be delivered after the First Amendment Effective Date in accordance with Section 6.12 of the Amended Credit Agreement.
This paragraph, and the provisions herein, shall be referred to as the “Conditionality Limitation”; and
(n)                                 Closing Certificate.

SECTION EIGHT— SEVERABILITY.

9
the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Loan Parties under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, as amended hereby, or any other Loan Document, and shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way affect any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Amended Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, as amended hereby, or any other Loan Document, all of which are ratified and affirmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and effect.

Except as provided in Section 2.12(d) or the last sentence of Section 2.18(f), for purposes of determining (i) whether the amount of any borrowing or Letter of Credit under the Multicurrency Revolving Commitments, together with all other borrowings and Letters of Credit under the Multicurrency Revolving Commitments then outstanding or to be borrowed at the same time as such borrowing, would exceed the total Multicurrency Revolving Commitments, (ii) the aggregate unused amount of the Multicurrency Revolving Commitments and (iii) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of borrowings and Multicurrency L/C Obligations, the outstanding principal amount of any borrowing or Multicurrency Letter of Credit that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the Foreign Currency of such borrowing or Letter of Credit determined as of the date of such borrowing or Letter of Credit.
Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a borrowing, Loan or Letter of Credit an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such borrowing, Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in a Foreign Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Agreed Foreign Currency Equivalent of such amount (rounded to the nearest 1,000 units of such Foreign Currency).
Each obligation hereunder of any party hereto that is denominated in a Currency of a country that is not a Participating Member State on the date hereof shall, effective from the date on which such country becomes a Participating Member State, be redenominated in euro in accordance
39
with the legislation of the European Union applicable to the European Monetary Union; provided that if and to the extent that any such legislation provides that any such obligation of any such party payable within such Participating Member State by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor either in euro or such Currency, such party shall be entitled to pay or repay such amount either in euro or in such Currency.
If the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to an Agreed Foreign Currency of any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the date on which such currency becomes an Agreed Foreign Currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such country becomes a Participating Member State; provided that with respect to any borrowing or Letter of Credit denominated in such Currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect at the end of the Interest Period therefor.
Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders and of the Lenders to the Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction or changeover to the euro in any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the date hereof.
Any baskets specified in this Agreement that are exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in applicable currency exchange rates after the last time such baskets were assessed will not be deemed to have exceeded solely as a result of such fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
1.5                               Calculation of Baskets.
If any of the baskets set forth in Section 7 of this Agreement are exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations to consolidated total assets or the financial ratios for the most recently completed fiscal quarter after the last time such baskets were calculated for any purpose under Section 7, such baskets will not be deemed to have been exceeded solely as a result of such fluctuations.
1.6                               Pro Forma Calculations.
Solely for purposes of determining whether any action is otherwise permitted to be taken hereunder, (i) any calculation to be determined on a “pro forma” basis, after giving “pro forma” effect to certain transactions or pursuant to words of similar import and (ii) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, in each case, shall be calculated as follows:
(a)                                  For purposes of making the computation referred to above, in the event that Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems, retires or extinguishes any Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement of the period for which such ratio is being calculated but on or prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation is made (a “Calculation Date”), then such calculation shall be made giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period; provided that, for purposes of making the computation of Consolidated Total Leverage for the computation of Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio referred to above, Consolidated Total Leverage shall be Consolidated Total Leverage as of the date the relevant action is being taken.
(b)                                  For purposes of making the computation referred to above, if any Investments, Dispositions or designations of Unrestricted Subsidiaries or Restricted Subsidiaries are made (or committed to be made pursuant to a definitive agreement) subsequent to the commencement of the period for which such calculation is being made but on or prior to or simultaneously with the relevant Calculation Date, then such calculation shall be made giving pro forma effect to such Investments, Dispositions and designations as if the same had
40
occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period in a manner consistent, where applicable, with the pro forma adjustments set forth in clause (o) of and the last proviso of the first sentence of the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA.”  If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment or Disposition that would have required adjustment pursuant to this provision, then such calculation shall be made giving pro forma effect thereto for such Test Period as if such Investment or Disposition had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period.
(c)                                   For purposes of determining any financial ratio or making any financial covenant calculation for any period or a portion of a period prior to the first delivery of financial statements pursuant to Section 6.1, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio shall be determined based on the most recent financial statements of Holdings that have been furnished as referred to in Section 4.1, and, to the extent that pro forma compliance with the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is required, the levels for such Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio shall be the levels set forth in Section 7.1(a) for the fiscal period ended December 31, 2012.

45
during which such Lender’s participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Lender’s pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all such Swingline Loans then due); provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swingline Lender.
(e)                                  Each Revolving Lender’s obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 2.7(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 2.7(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Revolving Lender or the Borrower may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
(f)                                   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event there is a Defaulting Lender, then such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Percentage with respect to all outstanding Swingline Loans will automatically be reallocated among the Revolving Lenders that are Non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata in accordance with each Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Percentage (calculated without regard to the Revolving Commitment of the Defaulting Lender) but only to the extent that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such reallocation (provided, that such amounts shall be automatically reallocated upon the cure or waiver of such Default or Event of Default) and that such reallocation does not cause the Revolving Extensions of Credit of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed the Revolving Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Lender.
No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
So long as there is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make a Swingline Loan to the extent that the sum of the Revolving Extensions of Credit of the Non-Defaulting Lenders after giving effect to such Swingline Loan would exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments of such Non-Defaulting Lenders.
46
(b)                                 Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.
(d)                                 The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender maintained pursuant to Section 2.8(c) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be presumptively correct absent demonstrable error of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

2.14                        Minimum Amounts and Maximum Number of Eurocurrency Tranches.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions, continuations and optional prepayments of Eurocurrency Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurocurrency Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Tranche shall be equal to a minimum of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than fifteen Eurocurrency Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.

(a)                                 the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for the Affected Currency for such Interest Period, or
(b)                                 the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that by reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement the Eurocurrency Rate for the Affected Currency determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (which action the Administrative Agent will take promptly after the conditions giving rise to such notice no longer exist), no further Eurocurrency Loans denominated in the Affected Currency (including the Eurocurrency Rate component of ABR Loans) under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in the Affected Currency.

(B)                               shall impose on such Lender any other condition not otherwise contemplated hereunder;
(b)                                 If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority first made, in each case, subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such corporation’s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a reasonably detailed written request therefor (consistent with the detail provided by such Lender to similarly situated borrowers), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.
The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be obligated to make payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to penalties, interest and expenses if written demand therefore was not made by the Administrative Agent or such Lender within 180 days from the date on which such party makes payment for such penalties, interest and expenses.

If any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after deduction or withholding of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes, including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement.
(b)                                 The Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(g)                                  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall promptly pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be required to repay to the Administrative Agent or the Lender an amount in excess of the amount paid over by such party to the Borrower pursuant to this Section.
This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations.
2.21                        Indemnity.
Except with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Section 2.20, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense (other than lost profits, including the loss of Applicable Margin) that such Lender may actually sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.
A reasonably detailed certificate as to (showing in reasonable detail the calculation of) any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be presumptively correct in the absence of manifest error.
2.22                        Illegality.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof, in each case,
58
If a Substitute Basis is not agreed upon during the Negotiation Period, each affected Lender shall determine (and shall certify from time to time in a certificate delivered by such Lender to the Administrative Agent setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the computation of such amount) the rate basis reflecting the cost to such Lender of funding its Eurocurrency Loan denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency for any Interest Period commencing on or after the first day of an Affected Interest Period, until the circumstances giving rise to such Rate Determination Notice have ceased to apply, and such rate basis shall be binding upon the Borrower and such Lender and shall apply in lieu of the Eurocurrency Rate for the relevant Interest Periods.
If a Rate Determination Notice has been given, then until such Rate Determination Notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no Eurocurrency Loans of the applicable Lenders denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency shall have an Interest Period having a duration equal to an Affected Interest Period.
2.23                        Change of Lending Office.
Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Sections 2.19, 2.20(a) or 2.22 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and; provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Sections 2.19, 2.20(a) or 2.22.
59
2.24                        Replacement of Lenders.
The Borrower shall be permitted to replace with a financial entity or financial entities, any Lender that (i) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Sections 2.19, 2.20 or 2.21 or gives a notice of illegality pursuant to Section 2.22, (ii) is a Defaulting Lender, or (iii) has refused to consent to any waiver or amendment with respect to any Loan Document that requires such Lender’s consent and has been consented to by the Required Lenders; provided that (A) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (B) the replacement financial entity or financial entities shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (C) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.21 (as though Section 2.21 were applicable) if any Eurocurrency Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (D) the replacement financial entity or financial entities, (x) if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to the extent that an assignment to such replacement financial institution of the rights and obligations being acquired by it would otherwise require the consent of the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.6(b)(i)(B) and (y) shall pay (unless otherwise paid by the Borrower) any processing and recordation fee required under Section 10.6(b)(ii)(B), (E) the Administrative Agent and any replacement financial entity or entities shall execute and deliver, and such replaced Lender shall thereupon be deemed to have executed and delivered, an appropriately completed Assignment and Assumption to effect such substitution, (F) the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Sections 2.19 or 2.20, as the case may be, in respect of any period prior to the date on which such replacement shall be consummated, (G) if applicable, the replacement financial entity or financial entities shall consent to such amendment or waiver and, (H) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
Each Lender hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable power of attorney (which power is coupled with an interest) to execute and deliver, on behalf of such Lender as assignor, any Assignment and Assumption necessary to effectuate any assignment of such Lender’s interests hereunder in respect of the circumstances contemplated by this Section and to be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 2.24.
The prepayment of Loans or termination of the Revolving Commitments of any Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 2.18.
2.25                        Incremental Loans.
60
(b) Such New Term Loan Commitments or increase of the Dollar Revolving Commitments shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date; provided that (i) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 were satisfied or waived on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such New Term Loan Commitments and to the making of any Tranche of New Term Loans pursuant thereto or to such increase of the Dollar Revolving Commitments and after giving effect to any transaction consummated in connection therewith; (ii) the Borrower shall be in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 7.1 as of the end of the most recently ended Test Period; (iii) the proceeds of any New Term Loans shall be used for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (including Permitted Acquisitions and Investments permitted under Section 7.8); (iv) the New Term Loans shall share ratably in the Collateral and shall benefit ratably from the guarantees under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement; (v) the New Term Loans shall share ratably or less favorably in any mandatory prepayments of the existing Term Loans; (vi) the maturity date of New Term Loans thereof shall not be earlier than the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date and the weighted average life to maturity shall be equal to or greater than the weighted average life to maturity of the Tranche B Term Loans; (vii) all terms and documentation with respect to any New Term Loans which differ from those with respect to the Tranche B Term Loans shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (except to the extent permitted by clause (vi) and, with respect to New Term Loans under the Tranche B Term Facility, clause (x) of this Section, and the last sentence of this paragraph); (viii) such New Term Loans or New Term Loan Commitments or increase of the Dollar Revolving Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Joinder Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and one or more New Lenders; and (ix) the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any customary legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction, including any supplements or amendments to the Security Documents providing for such New Term Loans to be secured thereby; and (x) if the initial “spread” (for purposes of this Section 2.25, the “spread” with respect to any Loan shall be calculated as the sum of the Eurodollar Loan margin on the relevant Loan plus any original issue discount or upfront fees in lieu of original issue discount (other than any arranging fees, underwriting fees and commitment fees) (based on an assumed four-year average life for the applicable Facilities (e.g., 100 basis points in original issue discount or upfront fees equals 25 basis points of interest rate margin))) relating to the New Term Loans incurred before the 18-month anniversary of the First Amendment Effective Date exceeds the spread then in effect with respect to the Tranche B Term Loans by more than 0.50%, the Applicable Margin relating to the existing Tranche B Term Loans shall be adjusted so that the spread relating to such New Term Loans does not exceed the spread applicable to the existing Tranche B Term Loans by more than 0.50%; provided that if the New Term Loans include an interest rate floor greater than the interest rate floor applicable to the Tranche B Term Loans, such increased amount shall be equated to the applicable interest rate margin for purposes of determining whether an increase to the Applicable Margin for the Tranche B Term Loans shall be required, to the extent an increase in
61
the interest rate floor for the Tranche B Term Loans would cause an increase in the interest rate then in effect thereunder, and in such case the interest rate floor (but not the Applicable Margin) applicable to the Tranche B Term Loans shall be increased by such amount.
Any New Term Loans made on an Increased Amount Date that have terms and provisions that differ from those of the Term Loans outstanding on the date on which such New Term Loans are made shall be designated as a separate tranche (a “Tranche”) of Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement, except as the relevant Joinder Agreement otherwise provides.
For the avoidance of doubt, the rate of interest and the amortization schedule (if applicable) of any New Term Loan shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable lenders of New Term Loans (each, a “New Term Lender”) and shall be set forth in the applicable Joinder Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conditions precedent to each such increase or New Term Facility shall be agreed to by the Lenders providing such increase or New Term Facility, as applicable, and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower; provided that in connection with the incurrence of any New Term Loans, if the proceeds of such New Term Loans are, substantially concurrently with the receipt thereof, to be used, in whole or in part, by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to finance, in whole or in part, a Permitted Acquisition, then (A) the only representations and warranties that will be required to be true and correct in all material respects as of the applicable Increase Effective Date shall be (x) customary “specified representations” and (y) such of the representations and warranties made by or on behalf of the applicable acquired company or business in the applicable acquisition agreement as are material to the interests of the Lenders, but only to the extent that Holdings or the Borrower (or any Affiliate of Holdings or the Borrower) has the right to terminate the obligations of Holdings, the Borrower or such Affiliate under such acquisition agreement or not consummate such acquisition as a result of a breach of such representations or warranties in such acquisition agreement and (B) no Event of Default under Sections 8.01(a), (f) or (g) would exist after giving effect to such incurrence.
(b)                                 (c) On any Increased Amount Date on which any New Term Loan Commitments or increase of the Dollar Revolving Commitments becomes effective, subject to the foregoing terms and conditions, each lender with a New Term Loan Commitment or an increase of the Dollar Revolving Commitments (each, a “New Lender”) shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such New Term Loan Commitment or such increase of the Dollar Revolving Commitments, as the case may be.
(c)                                  (d) The terms and provisions of the New Term Loan Commitments of any Tranche shall be, except as otherwise set forth in the relevant Joinder Agreement, identical to those of the applicable Term Loans and for purposes of this Agreement, any New Term Loans or New Term Loan Commitments shall be deemed to be Term Loans.
Each Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.25.
2.26                        Defaulting Lenders.
62
behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Waterfall.
Any payment of principal, interest or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise and other than the payment of (i) any commitment fees under Section 2.9, (ii) default interest pursuant to Section 2.15(c) and (iii) Letter of Credit fees pursuant to Section 3.3, which in each case shall be applied pursuant to the provisions of those Sections) shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.7; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender (without duplication of any prepayments of Swingline Loans by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.7(f) or the application of any cash collateral provided by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.4(d)) to any Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to be held as security for any L/C Shortfall (without duplication of any cash collateral provided by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.4(d)) in a cash collateral account to be established by, and under the sole dominion and control of, the Administrative Agent; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders or Swingline Lenders as a result of any final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lenders or Swingline Lenders against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility without giving effect to Sections 2.7(f) and 3.4(d).
Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to be held as security in a cash collateral account pursuant to this Section 2.26(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender and shall satisfy the Borrower’s payment obligation in respect thereof in full, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
SECTION 3.                            LETTERS OF CREDIT
3.1                               L/C Commitment.
(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Lender of a Class, in reliance on the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders of such Class set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit (“Letters of Credit”) under the Revolving Commitments of such Class for the account of the Borrower or any Guarantor on any Business Day
63
during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender; provided that no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations of both Classes taken together would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments of such Class would be less than zero.
(b)                                 No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit (or amend, renew or extend an outstanding Letter of Credit) if such issuance (or such amendment, renewal or extension) would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Lender to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law and Barclays Bank PLC shall not be obligated to issue any documentary or commercial letters of credit (as opposed to standby letters of credit) hereunder.
3.2                               Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit.
3.3                               Fees and Other Charges.
64
shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrower prior to such time; provided further that any Defaulting Lender’s ratable share of any letter of credit fee accrued on the aggregate amount available to be drawn on any outstanding Letters of Credit shall accrue for the account of each Non-Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letters of Credit which has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(d) and with respect to any L/C Shortfall either (i) if the Borrower has paid to the Administrative Agent, an amount of cash or Cash Equivalent equal to the amount of the L/C Shortfall to be held as security for all obligations of the Borrower to the Issuing Lenders hereunder in a cash collateral account to be established by, and under the sole dominion and control of, the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Borrower or (ii) otherwise, for the account of the Issuing Lenders, in each case so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender.
3.4                               L/C Participations.
(a) Each Issuing Lender of a Class irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant of such Class, and, to induce such Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit of such Class, each L/C Participant of such Class irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from such Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant’s own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant’s Dollar Revolving Percentage or Multicurrency Revolving Percentage, as the case may be, in such Issuing Lender’s obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit of the applicable Class issued by it and the amount of each draft paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder.
Each L/C Participant of a Class agrees with each Issuing Lender of such Class that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit of such Class issued by it for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender upon demand an amount equal to such L/C Participant’s Dollar Revolving Percentage or Multicurrency Revolving Percentage, as the case may be, of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed (“L/C Disbursements”); provided that nothing in this paragraph shall relieve the Issuing Lender of any liability resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender.
Each L/C Participant’s obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against any Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the financial condition of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing
65
A certificate of the relevant Issuing Lender submitted to any relevant L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be presumptively correct in the absence of manifest error.
(d)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event an L/C Participant becomes a Defaulting Lender, then such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Percentage in all outstanding Letters of Credit will automatically be reallocated among the L/C Participants that are Non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata in accordance with each Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Percentage (calculated without regard to the Revolving Commitment of the Defaulting Lender) but only to the extent that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such reallocation (provided, that such amounts shall be automatically reallocated upon the cure or waiver of such Default or Event of Default) and that such reallocation does not cause the Revolving Extensions of Credit of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed the Revolving Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Lender.
66
3.6                               Obligations Absolute.
The Borrower’s obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.
The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of such Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee, or any other events or circumstances that, pursuant to applicable law or the applicable customs and practices promulgated by the International Chamber of Commerce, are not within the responsibility of such Issuing Lender, except for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender or its employees or agents, as determined, in each case, in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.
No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender or its employees or agents, as determined, in each case, in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.
The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the standards or care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower.
3.7                               Letter of Credit Payments.
The responsibility of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit.
3.8                               Applications.
To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.
67
SECTION 4.
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, Holdings and the Borrower hereby jointly represent and warrant (as to itself and each of its Subsidiaries) to the Agents and each Lender, which representations and warranties shall be deemed made on the Closing Date and on the date of each borrowing of Loans or issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder that:
4.1                               Financial Condition.
The audited consolidated balance sheet of Holdings and its Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2009, September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2011, and the related statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, present fairly in all material respects the financial condition of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, as at such date, and the results of, their operations, their cash flows and their changes in stockholders’ equity for the respective fiscal years then ended.
The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Holdings and its Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2012, and the related unaudited statements of income and of cash flows for the nine-months ended on such date present fairly in all material respects the financial condition of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, as at such date, and the results of, their operations, their cash flows and their changes in stockholders’ equity for the nine-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the lack of footnotes).
All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto and year endyear-end adjustments, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein).
4.2                               No Change.
There has been no event, development or circumstance since September 30, 2011 that has had or will have a Material Adverse Effect.
4.3                               Existence; Compliance with Law.
Each of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than any Immaterial Subsidiaries) (a) (i) is duly organized (or incorporated), validly existing and in good standing (or, only where if applicable, the equivalent status in any foreign jurisdiction) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation, (ii) has the corporate or organizational power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its Property, to lease the Property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or limited liability company and in good standing (where such concept is relevant) under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of Property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification except, in each case, to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or in good standing (where such concept is relevant) would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that any such failure to comply therewith would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
To the extent applicable and except where a failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Loan Party and Subsidiary of Holdings is in compliance, in all material respects, with (i) the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, and each of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31 C.F.R., Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) (“OFAC”) and any other enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto, and (ii) the PATRIOT Act and (iii) the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”).
No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for (i) any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain,
68
retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the FCPA or (ii) the purpose of funding any activity or business for any Person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC or the government of a country the subject of U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC.

Each Loan Party has the corporate power and authority to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to borrow or have Letters of Credit issued hereunder.
Each Loan Party has taken all necessary corporate or other action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, no consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the extensions of credit hereunder or the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except (i) consents, authorizations, filings and notices described in Schedule 4.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and notices have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect or the failure to obtain which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) the filings referred to in Section 4.17.
This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party that is a party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law) and the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.
4.5                               No Legal Bar.

SECTION 9.
THE AGENTS
9.1                               Appointment.
Each Lender and the Issuing Lenders hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each Agent as the agent of such Lender or Issuing Lender under the Loan Documents and each such Lender and Issuing Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the applicable Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to such Agent by the terms of the applicable Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
9.2                               Delegation of Duties.
Each Agent may execute any of its duties under the applicable Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
Neither Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.
9.3                               Exculpatory Provisions.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement:
101
(a)                                 Neither Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Agent:
(A)                               shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.
Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties;
(B)                               shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders; provided that neither Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effectaffect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
(C)                               shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
(b)                                 Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.
9.4                               Reliance by the Agents.
The Agents shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.
The Agents also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.
In determining compliance with any condition hereunder that by its terms
102
must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of any Facility), each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of any Facility) unless such Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of any Facility) prior to any such condition being fulfilled.
The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts, except to the extent any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses resulting from any such action (or inaction) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Agent-Related Party.
9.5                               Notice of Default.
Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless such Agent has received notice from a Lender, Holdings or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”.
The Agents shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of any Facility); provided that unless and until such Agent shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
9.6                               Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.
Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
9.7                               Indemnification.
The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent, Issuing Lender, Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against each such Agent, Issuing Lender, Joint Lead Arranger or Joint Bookrunner in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by each such Agent, Issuing Lender, Joint Lead Arranger or Joint Bookrunner, under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision
103
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent’s, Issuing Lender’s, Joint Lead Arranger’s or Joint Bookrunner’s, as applicable, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any U.S. Federal Income Tax.
If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold U.S. Federal Income Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal Income Tax ineffective or for any other reason, or if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement without deduction of applicable withholding tax from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in connection therewith.
9.8                               Agent in Its Individual Capacity.
Each Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Agent were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include each Person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.
9.9                               Successor Agents.
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of such bank with an office in New York, New York, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Sections 8.1(a) or 8.1(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to the approval of the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
If such Person is removed as an Agent, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have
104
occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such retiring Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans.
Such removal will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be effective on the date a replacement Agent is appointed.
Upon the acceptance of a successor agent’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.
The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor agent.
After the retiring or removed Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section and Section 9.7 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by such Agent while such Agent was acting as an Agent.
9.10                        Authorization to Release Liens and Guarantees.
The Agents are hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders to effect any release or subordination of Liens or Guarantee Obligations contemplated by Section 10.16.
9.11                        Joint Lead Arrangers, Joint Bookrunners, Documentation Agents and Syndication Agents.
None of the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Joint Bookrunners, the Documentation Agents nor the Syndication Agents shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in their respective capacities as such, and none of the Joint Lead Arrangers, Joint Bookrunners, the Documentation Agents and Syndication Agents shall be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or any other Person by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
9.12                        Issuing Lender
Issuing Lender.
Each Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Revolving Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each Issuing Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities (a) provided to the Agents in this Section 9 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it as fully as if the term “Agent” as used in this Section 9, and (b) as additionally provided herein with respect to each Issuing Lender.
105
9.13                        Administrative Agent May File Proof of Claims.
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a)                                 to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.9 and 9.7, as applicable) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.9 and 9.7, as applicable.

In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agents shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing unless limited by the terms of such waiver; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender (other than any Debt Fund Affiliate) shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders or Affiliate Lenders (other than Debt Fund Affiliates)), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender may not be increased or extended, the maturity of any of its Loans may not be extended, the rate of interest on any of its Loans may not be reduced and the principal amount of any of its Loans may not be forgiven, in each case without the consent of such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender in its capacity as a Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Agents, Holdings and the Borrower (a) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement (it being understood that no Lender shall have any obligation to provide or to commit to provide all or any portion of any such additional credit facility) and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans, New Term Loans (if any) and Revolving Extensions of Credit and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders and Majority Facility Lenders.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Agents, Holdings, the Borrower and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to permit the refinancing of all or a portion of the then
107
outstanding Term Loans or New Term Loans of any Class (“Refinanced Term Loans”) with a replacement term loan tranche hereunder (“Replacement Term Loans”); provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced Term Loans then outstanding plus accrued interest, fees, discounts, premiums and expenses, (b) the Applicable Margin for such Replacement Term Loans shall not be higher than the Applicable Margin for such Refinanced Term Loans, (c) the weighted average life to maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the weighted average life to maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans at the time of such refinancing and (d) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans than, those applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the latest final maturity of the Term Loans or New Term Loans in effect immediately prior to such refinancing.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Agents, Holdings, the Borrower and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Revolving Commitments (as defined below) to permit the refinancing of all or a portion of the then outstanding Revolving Commitments of either Class (“Refinanced Revolving Commitments”) with a replacement revolving tranche hereunder (“Replacement Revolving Commitments”); provided that (i) the aggregate amount of such Replacement Revolving Commitments shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced Revolving Commitments then outstanding, (ii) the maturity date or commitment termination date of such Replacement Revolving Commitments shall not be earlier than the maturity date or commitment termination date of such Refinanced Revolving Commitments at the time of such refinancing and (iii) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Revolving Commitments shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Commitments than, those applicable to such Refinanced Revolving Commitments, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the final maturity of the Revolving Loans in effect immediately prior to such refinancing.
Such notice shall set forth (i) the terms and conditions of the requested Permitted Amendment and (ii) the date on which such Permitted Amendment is requested to become effective.
Permitted Amendments shall become effective only with respect to the Loans and/or Commitments of the Lenders that accept the applicable Loan Modification Offer (such Lenders, the “Accepting Lenders”) and, in the case of any Accepting Lender, only with respect to such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments as to which such Lender’s acceptance has been made.
Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Loan Modification Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Permitted Amendment evidenced thereby and only with respect to the Loans and Commitments of the Accepting Lenders as to which such
108
Lenders’ acceptance has been made and (ii) any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, that by its express terms amends or modifies the rights or duties under this Agreement or such other Loan Document of Lenders under a particular Facility (but not Lenders under any other Facility) and that would require Required Lender approval under Section 10.1 may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing signed by the Company or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, and the Majority Facility Lenders under each affected Facility as if all such affected Lenders under the applicable Facility were the only Lenders hereunder at the time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in connection with any “Required Lender”, “Majority Facility Lender” or “Required Prepayment Lender” votes, Lenders that are Debt Fund Affiliates shall not be permitted, in the aggregate to account for more than 50% of the amounts includable in determining whether the “Required Lenders”, “Majority Facility Lender” or “Required Prepayment Lender” have consented to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action that is subject to such vote.
The voting power of each Lender that is a Debt Fund Affiliate shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary in order to comply with the immediately preceding sentence.

112
Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (ii) each Issuing Lender or each Swingline Lender from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as an Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender, as applicable) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (iii) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.7 (subject to the terms of Section 2.18) or (iv) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to the Borrower or any other Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (x) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise provided to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8 and (y) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.18, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights or remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.

114
(c)                                  in the case of an assignment under a Revolving Facility, each Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender for such Facility.
(B)                               Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
115

No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c)                                  (A) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations (other than to a Defaulting Lender or any Disqualified Institution without the consent of the Borrower or to any natural person) to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and (2) directly affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, including for purposes of the definition of Excluded Taxes.
(B)                                A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent to such greater amounts or such greater payment results from a change in applicable law following the sale of the participation to such Participant.
No Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.20 unless such Participant complies with Section 2.20(d) or (e), as (and to the extent) applicable, as if such Participant were a Lender.
(C)                                Each Lender that sells a participation pursuant to this Section 10.6, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes), shall maintain a register comparable to the Register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the economic interests of each Participant in all or a portion of the Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments, Loans and/or Letters of Credit owing to it) (the “Participant Register”).
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for
116
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in “registered form” within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(d)                                 Any Lender may, without the consent of or notice to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(f)                                   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as provided in Sections 10.6(g) and 10.6(h), neither Holdings nor any Affiliate of Holdings may acquire by assignment, participation or otherwise any right to or interest in any of the Commitments or Loans hereunder (and any such attempted acquisition shall be null and void).
(g)                                  So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, each Term Lender of any Class shall have the right at any time to sell, assign or transfer all or a portion of its Term Loans or New Term Loans of such Class on a non-pro rata basis to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to the following limitations:
(A)                               Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries may conduct one or more modified Dutch auctions (each, an “Auction”) to repurchase all or any portion of the Term Loans or New Term Loans of any Class, provided that, (A) the Auction shall be made to Term Lenders of such Class on a pro rata basis in accordance with their Tranche A Term Percentages, Tranche B Term Percentages or New Tranche Term Percentages, as the case may be, and (B) the Auction shall be conducted pursuant to such procedures as the Auction Manager may establish which are consistent with this Section 10.6(g) and the procedures set forth on Exhibit J hereto and are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent;
117
Agreement in lieu of an Assignment and Assumption; and
(C)                               Following repurchase by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 10.6(g), the Term Loans or New Term Loans of any Class so repurchased shall, without further action by any Person, be deemed cancelled for all purposes and no longer outstanding (and may not be resold by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries), for all purposes of this Agreement and all other Loan Documents, including, but not limited to (A) the making of, or the application of, any payments to the Lenders under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (B) the making of any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or (C) the determination of Required Lenders, or for any similar or related purpose, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
In connection with any Term Loans or New Term Loans of any Class, repurchased and cancelled pursuant to this Section 10.6(g), Administrative Agent is authorized to make appropriate entries in the Register to reflect any such cancellation.
(A)                               Such assignment is made pursuant to an open market purchase;
(C)                               After giving effect to such assignment, Other Affiliates (other than Debt Fund Affiliates) shall not, in the aggregate, own or hold Term Loans or New Term Loans with an aggregate principal amount in excess of 20% of the principal amount of all Loans then outstanding; and
(D)                               Such Other Affiliate shall at the time of such assignment affirm the No Undisclosed Information Representation and shall at all times thereafter be subject to the voting restrictions specified in Section 10.1.
(i)                                     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Affiliate Lender shall have any right to (i) attend (including by telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any Lender to which representatives of the Borrower are not then present or (ii) receive any information or material prepared by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication by or among Administrative Agent and one or more Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials have been made available to the Borrower or its representatives.
10.7                        Adjustments; Set-off.
(a)  Except to the extent that this Agreement provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a “Benefitted Lender”) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender’s Obligations, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender’s Obligations, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such
118
Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.
(b)                                 In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) after the expiration of any cure or grace periods, to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final but excluding trust accounts), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (i) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.26(b) and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders, and the Lenders, and (ii) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.
(c)                                  To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and each Issuing Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect.
10.8                        Counterparts, Electronic Execution.
(a)                                 This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
119
(b)                                 The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption or in any amendment or other modification hereof (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state Laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
10.9                        Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of Holdings, the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
10.11                 GOVERNING LAW.
10.12                 Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers.
Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:
(i)                                     submits for itself and its Property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof;
(ii)                                  consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;
(iv)                              agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and
(v)                                 waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
120
10.13                 Judgment Currency.
This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or any Agreed Foreign Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Currency”), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Place”), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency.
The payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged or satisfied by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder.
The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in this Section called an “Entitled Person”) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred.
10.14                 Acknowledgments.
In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that: (a) (i) no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and any Agent, Joint Lead Arranger, any Issuing Lender, any Swingline Lender or any Lender is intended to be or has been created in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether any Agent, Joint Lead Arranger, any Issuing Lender, any Swingline Lender or any Lender has advised or is advising the Borrower or any Subsidiary on other matters, (ii) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders, on the other hand, (iii) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent that it has deemed appropriate and (iv) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; and (b) (i) the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person; (ii) none of the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged, for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in a broad range of transactions that
121
involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and none of the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates.
To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.
The Agents and the Lenders agree to treat any and all information, regardless of the medium or form of communication, that is disclosed, provided or furnished, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of Holdings or any of its affiliates, whether in writing, orally, by observation or otherwise and whether furnished before or after the Closing Date (“Confidential Information”), strictly confidential and not to use Confidential Information for any purpose other than negotiating, making available, syndicating and administering this Agreement (the “Agreed Purposes”).

Each Agent and each Lender acknowledges that (i) Confidential Information includes information that is not otherwise publicly available and that such non-public information may constitute confidential business information which is proprietary to Holdings and (ii) Holdings has advised the Agents and the Lenders that it is relying on the Confidential Information for its success and would not disclose the Confidential Information to the Agents and the Lenders without the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement.
10.16                 Release of Collateral and Guarantee Obligations; Subordination of Liens.
(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, upon request of Holdings in connection with any Disposition of Property permitted by the Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender, or any affiliate of any Lender that is a party to any Specified Hedge Agreement, any documentation in respect of Cash Management Obligations or contingent or indemnification obligations not then due) take such actions
122
as shall be required to release its security interest in any Collateral being Disposed of in such Disposition, and to release any Guarantee Obligations under any Loan Document of any Person being Disposed of in such Disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such Disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents.
Any representation, warranty or covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such Property so Disposed of (other than Property Disposed of to Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) shall no longer be deemed to be repeated once such Property is so Disposed of.
(b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when all Obligations (other than (x) obligations in respect of any Specified Hedge Agreement or Cash Management Obligations and (y) any contingent or indemnification obligations not then due) have been paid in full, all Commitments have terminated or expired and no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding that is not cash collateralized or backstopped, upon request of Holdings or the Borrower, the Collateral Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender, or any affiliate of any Lender that is a party to any Specified Hedge Agreement or documentation in respect of Cash Management Obligations) take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all Collateral, and to release all Guarantee Obligations under any Loan Document, whether or not on the date of such release there may be outstanding Obligations in respect of Specified Hedge Agreements or Cash Management Obligations or contingent or indemnification obligations not then due.
Any such release of Guarantee Obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such Guarantee Obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
(c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, upon request of Holdings in connection with any Liens permitted by the Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) take such actions as shall be required to subordinate the Lien on any Collateral to any Lien permitted under Section 7.3.
10.17      Accounting Changes.
In the event that any Accounting Change (as defined below) shall occur and such change results in a change in the method of calculation of financial covenants, standards or terms in this Agreement, then Holdings and the Administrative Agent agree to enter into negotiations in order to amend such provisions of this Agreement so as to equitably reflect such Accounting Changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating Holdings’ financial condition shall be the same after such Accounting Changes as if such Accounting Changes had not been made.
Until such time as such an amendment shall have been executed and delivered by Holdings, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, all financial covenants, standards and terms in this Agreement shall continue to be calculated or construed as if such Accounting Changes had not occurred.
“Accounting Changes” refers to changes in accounting principles required by the promulgation of any rule, regulation, pronouncement or opinion by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or, if applicable, the SEC.
123
10.19      USA PATRIOT ACT.
Each Lender hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Publ.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Loan Parties, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Loan Parties in accordance with the Act.
10.21      Interest Rate Limitation.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable Law (collectively, “charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for each day to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Guarantor as may be needed by such Specified Guarantor from time to time to honor all of its obligations under its Guaranty and the other Loan Documents in respect of any Swap Obligation (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section for up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this Article X voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).
The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the date upon which all Commitments under this Agreement have been terminated and all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.
Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each Specified Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
