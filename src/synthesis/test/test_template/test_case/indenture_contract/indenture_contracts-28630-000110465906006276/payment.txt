Closing Sale Price on such Trading Day x 20
(b)                                 The Company will not issue fractional shares of Applicable Stock upon conversion of the Securities but instead will pay the cash value of such fractional shares based upon the Closing Sale Price of the Applicable Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.

The amount of Contingent Interest payable per Security with respect to any six-month period will equal 0.50% per annum of the average market price of such Security for the five Trading Day period referred to above.
The Company will pay Contingent Interest, if any, in the same manner as it will pay interest as described in Section 6.1.

In addition, for value received, the Company hereby promises to pay to the Holder of this Note, or registered assigns, from January 31, 2006, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for, to, but not including, February 1, 2026, interest at an annual rate of 2.00% of the principal amount of this Note, except that interest will never be less than zero.
Interest on this Note is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 in each year (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), with the first Interest Payment Date being August 1, 2006.
Each payment of cash interest on this Note will include interest accrued through the day before the applicable Interest Payment Date.
From and after any six-month period from February 1 to July 31 and from August 1 to January 31, commencing with the six-month period beginning on February 1, 2011, the Company shall pay Contingent Interest on this Note under the circumstances and in the amounts described in Article XIV of the Indenture.
Such Contingent Interest, if any, shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the Record Date relating to such Interest Payment Date.
The amount of Contingent Interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of Notes in respect of any Contingent Interest Period shall equal 0.50% per annum of the average trading
2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026
Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

if any) which has accrued and shall be paid on such Interest Payment Date.

If a Holder of Notes converts after the Record Date for an interest payment, but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Holder on the Record Date will receive on that Interest Payment Date accrued interest on those Notes, despite the conversion of those Notes prior to that Interest Payment Date, because that Holder will have been the holder of record on the corresponding Record Date.

The Company will pay Additional Interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of Additional Interest, if any, (without regard to any applicable grace periods) from time to time on demand at a rate that is 1% per annum in excess of the rate then in effect.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
The Company will pay Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes to Holders of Notes as required by the Registration Rights Agreement on the next Additional Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled on or before such Additional Interest Payment Date,
Payment of Additional Interest, if any, will be made, at the Company’s option, either (a) by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth on the Election and Notice (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) delivered to the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement, (b) pursuant to the applicable procedures of DTC or (c) as otherwise set forth in the Indenture.
The Company will not pay any Additional Interest on any Note after it has been converted into cash, and, if applicable, shares of the Company’s common stock
Payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes (including Contingent Interest and Additional Interest, if any) shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
Payment of interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Interest, if any) on Certificated Securities in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or less shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address appears in the Register, and payment of interest on Certificated Securities in aggregate principal amount in excess of $5,000,000 shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds if requested in writing by the Holder of Notes at least 10 Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date and otherwise by check mailed to the Holder.
The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the Initial Purchasers’ option to purchase additional Notes set forth in the Purchase Agreement is exercised in full).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company may, at its option, redeem for cash all or a portion of the Notes at any time on or after February 1, 2009 and
prior to February 4, 2011, if the Closing Sale Price of the Company’s Common Stock has exceeded 130% of the Conversion Price for at least twenty (20) Trading Days in any consecutive 30-day trading period ending on the Trading Day prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Interest, if any) up to but not including the Redemption Date.
If the Company redeems the Notes as described above after February 1, 2009 and prior to February 4, 2011, the Company shall pay the “make-whole” premium in cash equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest on the notes to be redeemed through and including February 4, 2011.
The present value of the remaining interest payments will be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield.
“Treasury Yield” means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) that has become publicly available at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Redemption Date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source for similar market data)) most nearly equal to the then remaining term to February 4, 2011; provided, however, that if the then remaining term to February 4, 2011 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Yield shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yield are given, except that if the then remaining term to February 4, 2011 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
If the Redemption Date occurs after a Record Date and on or prior to an Interest Payment Date, accrued and unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest, if any) shall be paid on such Interest Payment Date to the record Holder on the relevant Record Date.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company may, at its option, redeem for cash all or a portion of the Notes at any time on or after February 4, 2011 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Interest, if any) to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Notes shall be paid at the Redemption Price.
Each Holder shall have the right, at the Holder’s option, but subject to the provisions of the Indenture, to require the Company to purchase all of such Holder’s Notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, on each of February 1, 2011, February 1, 2016 and February 1, 2021.
The Company shall be required to purchase such Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Interest, if any) to, but excluding, the Purchase Date.
In the event that a Fundamental Change shall occur at any time prior to the Stated Maturity, each Holder shall have the right, at the Holder’s option, but subject to the provisions of the Indenture, to require the Company to purchase all of such Holder’s Notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof.
The Company shall be required to purchase such Notes at a Fundamental Change Purchase Price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Additional Interest, if any) to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Purchase Date.
The conversion rate per $1,000 of principal amount of Notes is initially 16.7504 shares of Common Stock, and is subject to adjustment in certain events as set forth in the Indenture.
If and only to the extent a Holder elects to convert Notes in connection with certain types of Fundamental Changes to the extent set forth in the Indenture that occur on or prior to February 1, 2011 pursuant to which certain of the consideration for the Common Stock (other than cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters’ appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of cash or securities (or other property) that are not traded or scheduled to be traded immediately following such transaction on a U.S. national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, such Holder will be entitled to receive, in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, an additional number of shares of Common Stock as described in the Indenture, subject to a right of the Company to elect not to issue such additional shares but in lieu thereof to provide for the convertibility of the Notes into publicly-traded securities of the acquiring entity, all as set forth in the Indenture.
The Notes shall be issued in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of the principal amount and integral multiples thereof.
If you wish to have a portion of this Note purchased by the Company pursuant to ARTICLE IV or ARTICLE V of the Indenture, as applicable, state the amount (in principal amount):  $              .
