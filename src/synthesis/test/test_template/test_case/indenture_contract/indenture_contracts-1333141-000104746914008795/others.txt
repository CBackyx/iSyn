(3)                                 if since the beginning of such period the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (that subsequently became a Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or such Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) shall have made any Asset Disposition, any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above if made by the Company or such Subsidiary during such period, EBITDA for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Asset Disposition, Investment or acquisition occurred on the first day of such period.

SECTION 2.1                                                  Form and Dating.
The Notes and the notation relating to the Trustee’s certificate of authentication thereof, shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A (in the case of Global Notes) and Exhibit B (in the case of the Definitive Notes), as applicable.
The Notes may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage.
The Issuer and the Trustee shall approve the form of the Notes and any notation, legend or endorsement on them not inconsistent with the terms of this Indenture.
The terms and provisions contained in the Notes, annexed hereto as Exhibits A and B, shall constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and, to the extent applicable, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Paying Agent, by their execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound thereby.
The Notes will initially be represented by the Global Notes.
As long as the Notes are in global form, the Paying Agent (in lieu of the Trustee) shall be responsible for:
(2)                                 arranging on behalf of and at the expense of the Issuer for notices to be communicated to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
22
Each reference in this Indenture to the performance of duties set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above by the Trustee includes performance of such duties by the Paying Agent.
Notes offered and sold in their initial distribution in reliance on Regulation S shall be initially issued as one or more global notes, in registered, global form without interest coupons, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, with such applicable legends as are provided in Section 2.7(f)(ii), except as otherwise permitted herein, and shall be referred to collectively herein as the “Regulation S Global Note.”  The aggregate principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee (following receipt by the Trustee of all the information required hereunder), as hereinafter provided (or by the issue of a further Regulation S Global Note), in connection with a corresponding decrease or increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or in consequence of the issue of Definitive Notes or Additional Notes in the form of Regulation S Global Notes, as hereinafter provided.
The Regulation S Global Note and all other Notes that are not Rule 144A Notes shall collectively be referred to herein as the “Regulation S Notes.”
Notes offered and sold in their initial distribution in reliance on Rule 144A shall be initially issued as one or more global notes in registered, global form without interest coupons, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, with such applicable legends as are provided in Section 2.7(f)(ii), except as otherwise permitted herein, and shall be referred to collectively herein as the “Rule 144A Global Note.”  The aggregate principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee (following receipt by the Trustee of all information required hereunder), as hereinafter provided (or by the issue of a further Rule 144A Global Note), in connection with a corresponding decrease or increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note, or in consequence of the issue of Definitive Notes or Additional Rule 144A Global Notes, as hereinafter provided.
The Rule 144A Global Note and all other Notes (excluding interests in Rule 144A Global Notes which are transferred in accordance with Section 2.7(a) hereunder), if any, evidencing the debt, or any portion of the debt, initially evidenced by such Rule 144A Global Note, shall collectively be referred to herein as the “Rule 144A Notes.”
SECTION 2.2                                                  Execution and Authentication.
If a Responsible Officer whose signature is on a Note was a Responsible Officer at the time of such execution but no longer holds that office or position at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note, the Note shall be valid nevertheless.
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such signature as authentic and shall be under no obligation to make any investigation in relation thereto.
A Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Note.
The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture.
23
Except as otherwise provided herein, the aggregate principal amount of Notes which may be outstanding at any time under this Indenture is not limited in amount.
Additional Notes will be treated the same as the Initial Notes for all purposes under this Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
Such Issuer Order shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be authenticated, the type of Notes, the date on which the Notes are to be authenticated, the issue price and the date from which interest on such Notes shall accrue, whether the Notes are to be Initial Notes or Additional Notes and whether or not the Notes shall bear the Private Placement Legend, or such other information as the Trustee may reasonably request.
In authenticating the Notes and accepting the responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to the Notes, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that the form and terms thereof have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture, do not give rise to a Default and that the issuance of such Notes has been duly authorized by the Issuer.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent (“Authenticating Agent”) reasonably acceptable to the Issuer to authenticate Notes.
Unless otherwise provided in the appointment, an Authenticating Agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so.
Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Issuer and Affiliates of the Issuer.
SECTION 2.3                                                  Registrar and Paying Agent.
The Issuer may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents.
The term “Registrar” includes any co-registrar and the term “Paying Agent” includes any additional paying agent.
If the Issuer fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such.
The Issuer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar to the extent permitted under applicable laws or regulations.
24
The Issuer shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the provisions of the TIA.
The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture and the Notes that relate to such Agent.
If the Issuer fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, or fails to give the foregoing notice, the Trustee shall act as such, and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation in accordance with Section 7.7 hereof.
The Issuer initially appoints the Trustee to act as the Registrar and Paying Agent.
If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading on the Regulated Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such stock exchange so require, the Issuer shall appoint BNP Paribas Securities Services, or such other Person located in Luxembourg and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee (reasonableness to be determined objectively), as the Luxembourg paying and transfer agent (together with its successor in such capacity, the “Luxembourg Paying Agent”).
The Issuer initially appoints DTC to act as the Depositary with respect to the Global Notes.
SECTION 2.4                                                  Paying Agent To Hold Assets in Trust.
SECTION 2.5                                                  List of Holders.
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders.
SECTION 2.6                                                  Book-Entry Provisions for Global Notes.
25
(a)                                 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, a Global Note may not be transferred as a whole except by the DTC to a nominee of the DTC or by a nominee of the DTC to the DTC or another successor of the DTC or a nominee of such successor.
Interests of beneficial owners in the Global Notes may be transferred or exchanged for Definitive Notes in accordance with the rules and procedures of the DTC and the provisions of Section 2.7.
A Global Note may not be exchanged for a Definitive Note other than as provided in this Section 2.6(a).
(c)                                  Any Definitive Note delivered in exchange for an interest in a Global Note pursuant to Section 2.6(a) shall, except as otherwise provided by Section 2.7, bear the Private Placement Legend.
SECTION 2.7                                                  Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a Note remains outstanding, transfers of beneficial interests in Global Notes or transfers of Definitive Notes, in whole or in part, shall be made only in accordance with this Section 2.7.
26
(a)                                 If a holder of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note wishes at any time to exchange its interest in such Rule 144A Global Note for an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, or to transfer its interest in such Rule 144A Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in such Regulation S Global Note, such holder may, subject to the rules and procedures of the DTC, to the extent applicable, and to the requirements set forth in this Section 2.7(a), exchange or cause the exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Note.
(b)                                 If a holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note wishes at any time to exchange its interest in such Regulation S Global Note for an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note, or to transfer its interest in such Regulation S Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in such Rule 144A Global Note, such holder may, subject to the rules and procedures of the DTC, to the extent applicable, and to the requirements set forth in this Section 2.7(b), exchange or cause the exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in such Rule 144A Global Note.
27
After the expiration of the Restricted Period, the certification requirement set forth in clause (3) of the second sentence of this Section 2.7(b) will no longer apply to such transfers.
(c)                                  Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such an interest.
(d)                                 In the event that a Global Note is exchanged for Definitive Notes in registered form without interest coupons, pursuant to Section 2.6(a), or a Definitive Note in registered form without interest coupons is exchanged for another such Definitive Note in registered form without interest coupons, or a Definitive Note is exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Note, such Notes may be exchanged or transferred for one another only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of Sections 2.7(b) and (c) above (including the certification requirements intended to ensure that such exchanges or transfers comply with Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S, as the case may be) and as may be from time to time adopted by the Issuer and the Trustee.
(e)                                  Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be exchanged or transferred in accordance with the certification requirements hereof.
(f)                                   (i)  Other than in the case of Notes issued pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, each Note issued hereunder shall, upon issuance, bear the legend set forth in clause (ii) below (the “Private Placement Legend”) and such legend shall not be removed from such Note except as provided in the next
28
sentence.
The legend on a Note may be removed from a Note if there is delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of independent counsel licensed to practice law in the State of New York, as may be reasonably required by the Issuer and the Trustee, that neither such legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers of such Note will not violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and the Issuer and the Trustee consent to such removal.
If such a legend required for a Note has been removed from a Note as provided above, no other Note issued in exchange for all or any part of such Note shall bear such legend, unless the Issuer has reasonable cause to believe that such other Note is a “restricted security” within the meaning of Rule 144 and instructs the Trustee to cause a legend to appear thereon.
(ii)                                  To the extent required by paragraph (f)(i) above, the Notes shall bear the following legend on the face thereof:
29
NO REPRESENTATION CAN BE MADE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY RULE 144 FOR RESALE OF THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY.”
(g)                                  By its acceptance of any Note bearing the Private Placement Legend, each Holder of such a Note acknowledges the restrictions on transfer of such Note set forth in this Indenture and in the Private Placement Legend and agrees that it will transfer such Note only as provided in this Indenture.
Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall have any obligation or duty to monitor, and shall not be liable for any failure to, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners of interest in any Global Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
(j)                                    Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Definitive Note, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Definitive Note is registered as the absolute
30
owner of such Definitive Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Definitive Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Definitive Note is overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
(l)                                     All Notes issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Indenture will evidence the same debt and will be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
(m)                             Holders of Notes (or holders of interests therein) initially offered or sold in the United States to “Qualified Institutional Buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act pursuant to such rule and prospective purchasers designated by such Holders (or holders of interests therein) will have the right to obtain from the Issuer upon request by such Holders (or holders of interests therein) or prospective purchasers, during any period in which the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or not exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, the information required by paragraph d(4)(i) of Rule 144A in connection with any transfer or proposed transfer of such Notes.
SECTION 2.8                                                  Replacement Notes.
If required by the Trustee, the Registrar or the Issuer, such Holder must provide an indemnity bond or other indemnity, sufficient in the judgment of the Issuer, the Registrar and the Trustee, to protect the Issuer, the Registrar, the Trustee and any Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced.
The Issuer may charge such Holder for its reasonable out of-pocket expenses in replacing a Note, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel.
Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Issuer.
The provisions of this Section 2.8 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement of mutilated, destroyed, lost, stolen or taken Notes.
SECTION 2.9                                                  Outstanding Notes.
Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes that have been authenticated by the Trustee except those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the Global Note effected in accordance with the provisions hereof and those described in this Section 2.9 as not outstanding.
Subject to Section 2.10, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or any of its Affiliates holds the Note.
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.8 (other than a mutilated Note surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it, and upon which it shall be entitled to rely in accordance with Section 7.1(a), that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser.
A mutilated Note ceases to be outstanding upon surrender of such Note and replacement thereof pursuant to Section 2.8.
31
If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.1 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on it cease to accrue.
SECTION 2.10                                           Treasury Notes.
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates shall be disregarded, except that, for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Trust Officer actually knows are so owned shall be disregarded and the Trustee assumes no liability in relation to any other Notes.
SECTION 2.11                                           Temporary Notes.
The Officers’ Certificate shall specify the amount of temporary Definitive Notes to be authenticated and the date on which the temporary Definitive Notes are to be authenticated.
Temporary Definitive Notes shall be substantially in the form of permanent Definitive Notes but may have variations that the Issuer considers appropriate for temporary Definitive Notes.
SECTION 2.12                                           Cancellation.
If the Issuer shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.12.
32
SECTION 2.13                                           Defaulted Interest.
SECTION 2.14                                           CUSIP Numbers.
The Issuer in issuing the Notes may use “CUSIP” numbers, and if it does so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP numbers printed in the notice or on the Notes and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes.
SECTION 2.15                                           Deposit of Moneys.
SECTION 2.16                                           Certain Matters Relating to Global Notes.
Members of or participants in the DTC (“Agent Members”) shall have no rights under this Indenture or any Global Note with respect to any Global Note held on their behalf by the DTC or its nominee, and the DTC or its nominee may be treated by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any agent of the Issuer or the Guarantors as the absolute owner of the Global Note for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Guarantors from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the DTC or its
33
nominee or impair, as between the DTC and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Note.
(a)                                 The Holder of any Global Note may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including DTC and its Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Notes.
SECTION 2.17                                           Record Date.
Unless otherwise set forth in this Indenture, the record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under this Indenture shall be determined as provided for in TIA § 316(c).

In the case of any partial redemption, the Trustee will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements
34
of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which such Notes are listed, and/or in compliance with the requirements of the DTC, or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal and exchange requirements); although no Note of $2,000 in original principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, notice of redemption relating to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
The selections made by the Trustee pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall always be subject to Section 7.2(d).

35
(g)                                  if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the identification of the particular Notes (or portion thereof) to be redeemed, as well as the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be outstanding after such partial redemption;
(h)                                 the paragraph of the Notes pursuant to which the Notes are to be redeemed; and

which change or amendment to such laws, treaties, regulations or official position is announced and becomes effective after the issuance of the Notes; provided, that the Issuer determines, in its reasonable judgment, that the obligation to pay such additional amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it; provided, further, that at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.
ARTICLE IV
COVENANTS
SECTION 4.1                                                  Payment of Notes.
SECTION 4.2                                                  Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Issuer shall maintain the office or agency (which office may be an office of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, Registrar or co-Registrar) required under Section 2.3 where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served.
If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 11.1.
The Issuer hereby initially designates the office of the Trustee, acting through its office at 100 Wall Street, Suite 1600, New York, New York 10005, as its office or agency as required under Section 2.3 hereof.
If the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading on the Regulated Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will appoint BNP Paribas Securities Services, or such other Person located in
38
Luxembourg and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee (reasonableness to be determined objectively), as an additional paying and transfer agent.
SECTION 4.3                                                  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness.

The Company shall also comply with the other provisions of Section 314(a) of the TIA.
In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period when the Issuer or the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act other than by virtue of the exemption therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company will furnish to any Holder or beneficial owner of Notes initially offered and sold in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act pursuant to such rule and any prospective purchaser in the United States designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, upon request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

If the Issuer or the Guarantors conduct business in any jurisdiction (an “Additional Taxing Jurisdiction”) other than a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and, as a result, are required by the law of such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction to deduct or withhold any amount on account of taxes imposed by such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction from payments under the Notes which would not have been required to be so deducted or withheld but for such conduct of business in such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the Additional Amounts provision described above shall be considered to apply to such Holders as if references in such provision to “Taxes” included taxes imposed by way of deduction or withholding by any such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein).
The Issuer will pay any present stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including any penalties, interest or other
45
liabilities related thereto) which arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery and registration of Notes upon original issuance and initial resale of the Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or in connection with any payment with respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes or any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein.
If at any time the Issuer changes its place of organization to outside of the United States or there is a new issuer organized outside of the United States, the Issuer or new issuer, as applicable, will pay any stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including any penalties, interest or other liabilities related thereto) which arise in the jurisdiction in which the Issuer or new issuer is organized (or any political subdivision thereof or therein) and are payable by the Holders of the Notes in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein under any law, rule or regulation in effect at the time of such change or thereafter.
The foregoing obligations of this Section 4.12 and Paragraph 2 of the Notes will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to the Issuer or the Guarantors.
Whenever in this Indenture or in the Notes or any Note Guarantee there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal, purchase price, premium or interest, if any, or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Issuer and the Company may not, and may not permit any Guarantor or any Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction unless:
(1)                                 the Issuer or such Guarantor or Subsidiary, as the case may be, could have created a Lien on the property subject to such Sale and Leaseback Transaction if such transaction was financed with Indebtedness without securing the Notes pursuant to Section 4.4; and
46
(2)                                 the Issuer or such Guarantor or Subsidiary, as the case may be, can Incur an amount of Indebtedness equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction.

47
entirety to any Person in accordance with Section 5.1, then if such transaction involves the Company, the Surviving Person shall expressly assume in a supplemental indenture in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, all of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and in any such case the Surviving Person shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer or such Guarantor under this Indenture with the same effect as if such Surviving Person had been named as the Issuer or had been a Guarantor herein, and thereafter the Issuer or such Guarantor shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants hereunder and under the Notes.
All the Notes so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Notes theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Notes had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

The Successor shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Indenture with the same effect as if it were the Issuer thereunder, and the former Issuer shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Notes.

Subject to Section 2.10, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, by written notice to the Trustee, direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it.
Subject to Section 7.1, however, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with any law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Holder of Notes, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

(3)                                 such Holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(5)                                 the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

SECTION 6.12                                           Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amount due to the Trustee under Section 7.7, accountants and experts) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relating to the Company, its creditors or its property or other obligor on the Notes, its creditors and its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any

Custodian in any such judicial proceedings is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agent and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7.
To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.

SECTION 6.14                                           Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder of any Note has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders of Notes shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
SECTION 6.15                                           Undertaking for Costs.

SECTION 7.1                                                  Duties of Trustee.
If an Event of Default actually known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request of any of the Holders of Notes, unless they shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security and indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense in accordance with the sixth paragraph of Section 7.7.
(a)                                 Except during the continuance of an Event of Default actually known to the Trustee:
(1)                                 The Trustee and the Agents will perform only those duties as are specifically set forth herein and no others and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee or the Agents.
(2)                                 In the absence of willful misconduct on their part, the Trustee and the Agents may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions and such other documents delivered to them pursuant to Section 11.2 and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture.
However, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
(b)                                 The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(1)                                 This paragraph does not limit the effect of subsection (a) of this Section 7.1.
54
(2)                                 Neither the Trustee nor Agent shall be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer of such Trustee or Agent, unless it is proved that the Trustee or such Agent was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.
(3)                                 The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.2, 6.7 or 6.8.
(c)                                  No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee or any Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or to take or omit to take any action under this Indenture or take any action at the request or direction of Holders if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds is not assured to it or it does not receive an indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against such risk, liability, loss, fee or expense which might be incurred by it in the performance of any of its duties hereunder.
(d)                                 Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to the first paragraph and subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.1.
(e)                                  Neither the Trustee nor the Agents shall be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee and any Agent may agree in writing with the Issuer.
Money held in trust by the Trustee or any Agent need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
(f)                                   Any provision hereof relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.1.
SECTION 7.2                                                  Rights of Trustee.
Subject to Section 7.1:
(a)                                 The Trustee and each Agent may rely conclusively on and shall be protected from acting or refraining from acting based upon any document believed by them to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person.
Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent order, approval, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security or other paper or document.

(b)                                 Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may consult with counsel and may require an Officers’ Certificate, Issuer Order (as applicable) or an Opinion of Counsel or both.
Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate or opinion.
55

(d)                                 The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it reasonably believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; provided, however, that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith.
(e)                                  The Trustee or any Agent may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice or opinion of such counsel as to matters of law shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.

The Trustee shall be entitled to request and conclusively rely on an Opinion of Counsel with respect to whether any consent, waiver, approval, amendment or modification shall have a material adverse effect on the interests of any Holder.
SECTION 7.3                                                  Individual Rights of Trustee.
The Trustee or any Agent in its respective individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer, the Guarantors, their Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or an Agent.
Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
SECTION 7.4                                                  Trustee’s Disclaimer.

The Issuer shall reimburse the Trustee and Agents upon request for all reasonable and duly documented and invoiced disbursements, expenses and advances (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for their services, except any such disbursements, expenses and advances as may be attributable to the Trustee’s or any Agent’s negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.
Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee’s and Agents’ accountants, experts and counsel and any taxes or other expenses incurred by a trust created pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof.
The Issuer agrees to pay the fees and expenses of the Trustee’s legal counsel in connection with its review, preparation and delivery of this Indenture and related documentation.
The Issuer shall indemnify each of the Trustee, any predecessor Trustee and the Agents (which, for purposes of this paragraph, include such Trustee’s and Agents’ officers, directors, employees and agents) for, and hold them harmless against, any and all loss, damage, claim, proceedings, demands, costs, expense or liability including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of the Trustee) incurred by the Trustee or an Agent without negligence or willful misconduct on its part in connection with acceptance of administration of this trust and performance of any provisions under this Indenture, including the reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees and expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability arising hereunder.
However, the failure by the Trustee or the Agent to so notify the Issuer shall not relieve the Issuer of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to Section 7.1(b), the Issuer need not reimburse or indemnify against any loss liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through its own willful misconduct or negligence.
The Issuer shall defend the claim and the Trustee or such Agent shall cooperate in the defense (and may employ its own counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) at the Issuer’s expense.

When the Trustee or an Agent incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in clause (7) of Section 6.1, the expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) and the compensation for the services shall be preferred over the status of the Holders in a proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law and are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
The Issuer’s obligations under this Section 7.7 and any claim or Lien arising hereunder shall survive the termination of this Indenture, the resignation or removal of any Trustee or Agent, the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations pursuant to Article VIII and any rejection or termination under any Bankruptcy Law.
Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Indenture, the Trustee shall have absolute and uncontrolled discretion as to the exercise of the discretion vested in the Trustee by this Indenture but, whenever the Trustee is bound to act under this Indenture at the request or direction of the Holders of Notes, the Trustee shall nevertheless not be so bound unless first indemnified to its satisfaction against all proceedings, claims and demands to which it may render itself liable and all costs, charges, expenses and liabilities which it may incur by so doing.
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee, is subject to this Section 7.7.
The Company shall be jointly and severally liable with the Issuer for all of the Issuer’s obligations pursuant to this Section 7.7.

A resignation or removal of the Trustee or any Agent and appointment of a successor Trustee or Agent, as the case may be, shall become effective only upon the acceptance by the successor Trustee or the successor Agent, as the case may be, of appointment as provided in this section.

(2)                                 a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or

Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may, with the Issuer’s consent, appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Issuer.
If the Issuer does not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee.
Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Issuer’s obligations under Section 7.7 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee and the Issuer shall pay to any replaced or removed Trustee all amounts owed under Section 7.7 upon such replacement or removal.
If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall, if such resulting, surviving or transferee corporation is otherwise eligible hereunder, be the successor Trustee.
In case any Notes shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by consolidation, merger or conversion to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes.
SECTION 7.10                                           Eligibility; Disqualification.

SECTION 7.11                                           Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company.
The Trustee is subject to TIA § 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA § 311(b).

The Issuer may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to the Notes, elect to have either Section 8.2 or 8.3 be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article VIII.
SECTION 8.2                                                  Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Issuer’s exercise under Section 8.1 of the option applicable to this Section 8.2, the Issuer shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, “Legal Defeasance”).
For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged all the obligations relating to the outstanding Notes and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed to be “outstanding” only for the purposes of Section 8.6, Section 8.8 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to below in this Section 8.2, and to have satisfied all of their other obligations under such Notes and this Indenture and cured all then existing Events of Default (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:  (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due or on the Redemption Date solely out of the Defeasance Trust created pursuant to this Indenture; (b) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, or, where relevant, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s or Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and (d) this Article VIII and the obligations set forth in Section 8.6 hereof.

Subject to compliance with this Article VIII, the Issuer may exercise its option under Section 8.2 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.3 with respect to the Notes.
SECTION 8.3                                                  Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Issuer’s exercise under Section 8.1 of the option applicable to this Section 8.3, the Issuer, the Company and the other Guarantors shall be released from any obligations under the covenants contained in Article IV, Section 5.1(4), Sections 6.1(3), (4) and (5), and Section 6.1 (7) (with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries other than the Issuer), hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, “Covenant Defeasance”), and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed not “outstanding” for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed “outstanding” for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes).
For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, (i) with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and (ii) payment on the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.1 (3), (4) or (5), or Section 6.1 (7) (with respect only to the Company and the Subsidiaries other than the Issuer).
SECTION 8.4                                                  Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.
In order to exercise either of the defeasance options under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 hereof, the Issuer must comply with the following conditions:
(2)                                 the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred.
In the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law;

(6)                                 such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of any other material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

AMENDMENTS, SUPPLEMENTS AND WAIVERS
SECTION 9.1                                                  Without Consent of Holders of Notes.
Notwithstanding Section 9.2 hereof, the Issuer and the Trustee together may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes without the consent of any Holder of a Note to:
64
(1)                                 cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
(2)                                 provide for the assumption by a successor entity of the obligations of the Issuer under and pursuant to this Indenture or of a Guarantor (other than the Company) under the Note Guarantees;
(3)                                 provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(B) of the Code);
(4)                                 add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes;
(5)                                 secure the Notes;
(6)                                 add to the covenants of the Issuer and the Guarantors for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer;
(7)                                 evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under this Indenture of any successor trustee;
(8)                                 comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;
(9)                                 issue Additional Notes in accordance with this Indenture; or
(10)                          make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of Notes under this Indenture.
SECTION 9.2                                                  With Consent of Holders of Notes.
The Issuer and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes or any amended or supplemental indenture with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including without limitation consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.7 and 6.10, any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including without limitation consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes).
However, without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note adversely affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder of Notes):
(1)                                 reduce the percentage of principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;
(2)                                 reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;
(3)                                 reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;
65
(4)                                 reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such Note may be redeemed as described under Section 3.1;
(5)                                 reduce the premium payable upon the repurchase of any Note, change the time at which any Note may be repurchased, or change any of the associated definitions related to the provisions of Section 4.11 once the obligation to repurchase the Notes has arisen;
(6)                                 make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;
(7)                                 impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of premium, if any, principal of and interest on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;
(8)                                 make any change in the amendment provisions which require each Holder’s consent or in the waiver provisions; or
(9)                                 release the Company from its Note Guarantee (other than in accordance with the terms of this Indenture).
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
SECTION 9.3                                                  Notice of Amendment, Supplement or Waiver.
Any failure of the Issuer to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.
SECTION 9.4                                                  Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note.
An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder of a Note.
An amendment or waiver becomes effective once the requisite number of consents is received by the Issuer or the Trustee.
The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for determining which Holders of the Notes must consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver.
66
SECTION 9.5                                                  Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article IX; provided, however, that the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which adversely affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture.
The Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, if delivered, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers’ Certificate each stating that the execution of any such amendment, supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors enforceable in accordance with its terms.
Any Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee.
With respect to any amendment, supplement or waiver under Section 9.2, the Trustee shall also be entitled to receive evidence satisfactory to it of the consent of the Holders.
ARTICLE X
NOTE GUARANTEE
SECTION 10.1                                           Note Guarantee.
The Note Guarantee extends to the Issuer’s repurchase obligations arising from a Change of Control pursuant to Section 4.11.
Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be irrevocable and unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of such Note or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on any collateral for, or any release or amendment or waiver of any term of any other Guarantee of, or any consent to departure from any requirement of any other Guarantee of all or any of the Notes, the effects of Bankruptcy Law applicable in the event of bankruptcy proceedings being opened with respect to the Issuer, of all or any portion of the
67
claims of the Trustee or any of the Holders for payment of any of the Notes, any waiver or consent by the Holder of such Note or by the Trustee with respect to any provisions thereof or of this Indenture, the obtaining of any judgment against the Issuer or any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.
Each Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or any of the Holders protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest in or other Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Issuer or any other Person or any collateral, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest or notice with respect to such Note or the Indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Note Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Note except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Note and in this Note Guarantee.
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest (including Additional Amounts, if any) on such Note, whether at its Stated Maturity, by acceleration, call for redemption, purchase or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Note, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Indenture, directly against each Guarantor to enforce the Note Guarantee without first proceeding against the Issuer.
Each Guarantor agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or any of the Holders is prevented by applicable law from exercising its respective rights to accelerate the maturity of the Notes, to collect interest on the Notes, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to the Notes, or the Trustee or the Holders are prevented from taking any action to realize on any collateral, such Guarantor agrees to pay to the Trustee for the account of the Holders, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Trustee or any of the Holders.
No provision of the Note Guarantee or of this Indenture shall alter or impair the Note Guarantee of any Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, of the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (including Additional Amounts, if any) on the Note upon which such Note Guarantee is endorsed.
Each Note Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Issuer for liquidation or reorganization or equivalent proceeding under applicable law, should the Issuer become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Issuer’s assets, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable law, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Notes, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Notes, whether as a voidable preference, fraudulent transfer, or as otherwise provided under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or under applicable laws of the jurisdiction of formation of the Issuer, all as though such payment or performance had not been made.
68
The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.
(b)                                 Each Note Guarantee (other than the Company’s Note Guarantee) will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Note Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or under applicable law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Guarantor.
(i)                                     Without limiting the agreements set forth in Section 11.8, the Note Guarantee of FMCD will be limited if and to the extent payment under such Note Guarantee or the application of enforcement proceeds would cause (x) FMCD’s net assets (Reinvermögen - calculated as the sum of the balance sheet positions shown under § 266(2)(A), (B) and (C) German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)) less the sum of the liabilities (shown under the balance sheet positions pursuant to § 266(3)(B), (C) and (D) German Commercial Code) to fall below FMCD’s registered share capital (Stammkapital) or (y) (if the amount of the net assets is already an amount less than the registered share capital) cause such amount to be further reduced and, in either case, thereby affecting the assets required for the obligatory preservation of its registered share capital according to section 30, 31 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) (such event a “Capital Impairment”).
For the purposes of calculating the Capital Impairment, the following adjustments will be made:  (x) the amount of any increase of the registered share capital out of retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) after the Closing Date that has been effected without the prior consent of the Trustee shall be deducted from the registered share capital; and (y) liabilities incurred in violation of the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture shall be disregarded.
In the event FMCD’s net assets fall below its registered share capital, FMCD, upon request of the Trustee will realize in due course, to the extent legally permitted, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets if the relevant assets are not necessary for FMCD’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendiges Vermögen).
The costs of such auditor’s determination shall be borne by FMCD.
The determination of the auditor shall be binding for FMCD, and the Holders (except for manifest error).
To the extent that any payment has been made under the Note Guarantee by FMCD that would be necessary for FMCD to be able to cure any Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment such payment shall immediately — upon
69
FMCD’s demand — be returned to FMCD by any person receiving such payment, provided, however, in no event shall the Trustee or Paying Agent have any responsibility or liability for the return of any amount distributed to any Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes by the Trustee or Paying Agent, including, without limitation, any obligation to seek return of such amounts from such Holder or beneficial owner.
The burden of demonstration and proof (Darlegungs- und Beweislast) regarding the Capital Impairment and the maximum amount payable under the Note Guarantee shall remain with FMCD.
(iv)                              The maximum amount payable under the guarantee shall be limited to the extent and as long as FMCD as a consequence of the payment would become unable to pay its debts when due (zahlungsunfähig) within the meaning of section 64 GmbHG (such event a “Liquidity Impairment”).
For the purpose of establishing whether a Liquidity Impairment would occur, payments made by FMCD after the Trustee has notified FMCD of its intention to enforce the Note Guarantee with respect to payment obligations that are not due at the time of the payment shall be disregarded, unless the Trustee has consented to such payments (at the direction of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding).
From the time the Trustee has notified FMCD and the Company of its intention to enforce the Note Guarantee, the Company may not make any payment demands against FMCD under shareholder loans and all such payment obligations of FMCD towards the Company shall be deferred, subordinated or waived as the Company sees fit, until the Trustee notifies FMCD that it is no longer enforcing the Note Guarantee or the Trustee consents (at the direction of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to the payments to be made to the Company.
The limitations in this Section 10.1(c) as to the Capital Impairment shall not apply to the extent FMCD has an adequate compensation claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) against the Company that compensates for any loss incurred due to any payment by FMCD under the Note Guarantee.
The limitations in this Section 10.1 (c) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the direct and indirect shareholders of FMCD (other than the Company) if and to the extent the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees constitutes a payment (Auszahlung) by the relevant shareholders of FMCD within the meaning of section 30 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG).
SECTION 10.2                                           Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantees.
70
The Note Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of the Company by two members of the Management Board of its General Partner and on behalf of any other Guarantor by such Person or Persons duly authorized by the Board of Directors or Management Board of such Guarantor.
The signature of any or all of these Persons on the Note Guarantee may be manual or facsimile.
A Note Guarantee bearing the manual or facsimile signature of individuals who were at any time the Responsible Officers of a Guarantor shall bind such Guarantor, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of the Note on which such Note Guarantee is endorsed or did not hold such offices at the date of such Note Guarantee.
Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 10.1 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse a Note Guarantee on any Note.
Except as set forth in Section 10.4 and in Article V hereof, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company, the Issuer or another Guarantor or shall prevent any sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company, the Issuer or another Guarantor.
SECTION 10.4                                           Release of Guarantors.
(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof, concurrently with any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor or any sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in each case as permitted by Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 10.3 hereof, and upon delivery by the Company or the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or other disposition was made in accordance with Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 10.3 hereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to acknowledge the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee endorsed on the Notes and under this Indenture.
Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee endorsed on the Notes and under this Indenture shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of (premium, if any) and interest (including Additional Amounts, if any) on the Notes and for the other obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee endorsed on the Notes and under this Indenture.
Concurrently with the defeasance of the Notes under Section 8.2 or satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture under Section 8.5 hereof, the Guarantors shall be released from all of their obligations under their Note Guarantees endorsed on the Notes and under this Indenture, without any action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of Notes.
(b)                                 Upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of merger or consolidation) of any Guarantor or the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof, such Guarantor
71
shall automatically be released from all obligations under its Note Guarantees endorsed on the Notes and under this Indenture in accordance with Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
(c)                                  At any time a Guarantor (other than the Company) is no longer an obligor under the Credit Facility, such Guarantor will be released and relieved from all of its obligations under its Note Guarantee.

SECTION 11.6                                           Governing Law.
SECTION 11.7                                           Submission to Jurisdiction.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Issuer and the Guarantors irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any U.S. federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States of America, in any suit or proceeding based on or arising under this Indenture or the Notes, and irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such suit or proceeding may be determined in any such court.
Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrevocably and fully waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit or proceeding and irrevocably waives to the fullest extent it may effectively do so any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and each of the Issuer and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably consents to be served with notice and service of process by delivery or by registered mail with return receipt requested addressed to FMCH’s registered agent, which as of the date hereof is CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10011 (which service of process by registered mail shall be effective with respect to the Issuer and the Guarantors so long as such return receipt is obtained, or in the event of a refusal to sign such receipt any Holder or the Trustee is able to produce evidence of attempted delivery by such means).
Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors further agrees that such service of process and written notice of such service to the Issuer and the Guarantors in the circumstances described above shall be deemed in every respect effective notice and service of process upon each of the Issuer and the Guarantors in any such action or proceeding.
Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Person to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors agrees that a final action in any such suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other lawful manner.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Issuer and the Guarantors hereby agrees that any action arising out of or based on this Indenture or the Notes may also be instituted in any competent court in Germany, and it expressly accepts the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action.
Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent permitted by law, any immunity to jurisdiction to which it may otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, immunity to pre-judgment attachment, post-judgment attachment and execution)
75
in any legal suit, action or proceeding against it arising out of or based on this Indenture or the Notes.
The provisions of this Section 11.7 are intended to be effective upon the execution of this Indenture without any further action by the Issuer and the Guarantors and the introduction of a true copy of this Indenture into evidence shall be conclusive and final evidence as to such matters.
SECTION 11.8                                           No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders.
No member of the Board of Directors, director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer, Fresenius SE, the general partner of Fresenius SE, the Company, the Company’s General Partner or the Guarantors, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes, this Indenture or the Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability and agrees not to enforce any claim in respect of the Notes, the Indenture or the Notes Guarantees to the extent that it would give rise to such personal liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
In addition, such waiver and release may not be effective under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.
SECTION 11.9                                           Successors.
All agreements of the Issuer in this Indenture and the Notes and the Guarantors in this Indenture and the Note Guarantees shall bind their respective successors.

SECTION 11.11                                    Severability.
In case any one or more of the provisions in this Indenture or in the Notes shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the provisions hereof shall be enforceable to the full extent permitted by law.
SECTION 11.12                                    Table of Contents, Headings, Etc.
The Table of Contents, Cross-Reference Table and headings of the Articles and Sections of this Indenture have been inserted for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Indenture and shall in no way modify or restrict any of the terms or provisions hereof.
SECTION 11.13                                    Trust Indenture Act Controls.
If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by TIA § 318(c), the imposed duties shall control.
SECTION 11.14                                    Currency Indemnity.
The U.S. dollar (or any of its successor currencies) is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer under this Indenture.
Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the U.S. dollar in respect
76
of the Notes (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Issuer only to the extent of the U.S. dollar amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so).
If that U.S. dollar amount is less than the U.S. dollar amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result.
In any event the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.
For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for the Holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had an actual purchase of U.S. dollars been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of U.S. dollars on such date had not been practicable, on the first date on which it would have been practicable).
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations of the Issuer, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading on the Regulated Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and the rules of such stock exchange so require, copies of this Indenture will be made available in Luxembourg through the offices of the Listing Agent in such city.

1.
Interest.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid.
2.
Additional Amounts.
All payments made under or with respect to the Notes under the Indenture or pursuant to any Note Guarantee must be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including penalties, interest and other liabilities related thereto) imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) the United States, Germany, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or any Note Guarantee is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax or (3) any other jurisdiction in which the payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident or engaged in business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), collectively, “Taxes,” unless the Issuer, relevant Guarantor or other applicable withholding agent is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof by the relevant government authority or agency.
If the Issuer, any Guarantor or other applicable withholding agent is so required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, will be required to pay such amount — “Additional Amounts” — as may be necessary so that the net amount (including Additional Amounts) received by each beneficial owner after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction on such Additional Amounts) will not be less than the amount such beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted;
A-5
provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to payments made to any beneficial owner to the extent such Taxes are imposed by reason of (i) such beneficial owner being considered to be or to have been connected with a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, otherwise than by the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of the Notes, the enforcement of rights under the Notes or under any Note Guarantee or the receipt of payments in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, or (ii) such beneficial owner not completing any procedural formalities that it is legally eligible to complete and are necessary for the Issuer, a Guarantor or other applicable withholding agent to make or obtain authorization to make payments without such Taxes (including, without limitation, providing prior to the receipt of any payment on or in respect of a Note or any Note Guarantee, a complete, correct and executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9 or successor form, as applicable, with all appropriate attachments or a comparable form required by another Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction).
Further, no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to (i) any Tax on interest imposed by the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein by reason of any beneficial owner holding or owning, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Issuer or any Guarantor entitled to vote, (ii) any Tax on interest imposed by the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein by reason of any beneficial owner being a controlled foreign corporation that is a related person within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, (iii) any Tax imposed on interest by the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein by reason of any beneficial owner being a bank extending credit pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business or (iv) any United States federal tax imposed pursuant to current sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with (collectively, “FATCA”).
The Issuer or any Guarantor (as applicable) required to withhold any Taxes will make such withholding or deduction and remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority as and when required in accordance with applicable law.
No such Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to the Notes under the Indenture or pursuant to any Note Guarantee where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to the EU Savings Directive on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.
A-6
The Issuer will pay any present stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including any penalties, interest or other liabilities related thereto) which arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery and registration of Notes upon original issuance and initial resale of the Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein or in connection with any payment with respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes or any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to herein or therein.
If at any time the Issuer changes its place of organization to outside of the United States or there is a new issuer organized outside of the United States, the Issuer or new issuer, as applicable, will pay any stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including any penalties, interest or other liabilities related thereto) which arise in the jurisdiction in which the Issuer or new issuer is organized (or any political subdivision thereof or therein) and are payable by the Holders of the Notes in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein under any law, rule or regulation in effect at the time of such change or thereafter.
References in this Paragraph 2 to the Issuer or any Guarantor shall apply to any successor(s) thereto.

which change or amendment to such laws, treaties, regulations or official position is announced and becomes effective after the issuance of the Notes (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction did not become a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction until a later date, after such later date); provided that the Issuer determines, in its reasonable judgment, that the obligation to pay such additional amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it; provided, further, that at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

16.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.
17.
Restrictive Covenants.
The Indenture imposes certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer, the Company, the Guarantors and their Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness, to incur additional Liens, to enter into Sale and Leaseback Transactions and enter into certain consolidations or mergers.
The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions.

No member of the Board of Directors, director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer, Fresenius SE, Fresenius SE’s general partner, the Company, the Company’s General Partner or the Guarantors, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes, the Indenture or the Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability and agrees not to enforce any claim in respect of the Notes, the Indenture or the Notes Guarantees to the extent that it would give rise to such personal liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
In addition, such waiver and release may not be effective under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

TO THE INDENTURE
FORM OF NOTE GUARANTEE
The Note Guarantee extends to the Issuer’s repurchase obligations arising from a Change of Control pursuant to the Indenture.
Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be irrevocable and unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of such Note or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on any collateral for, or any release or amendment or waiver of any term of any other Guarantee of, or any consent to departure from any requirement of any other Guarantee of, all or any of the Notes, the effects of Bankruptcy Law applicable in the event of bankruptcy proceedings being opened with respect to the Issuer, of all or any portion of the claims of the Trustee or any of the Holders for payment of any of the Notes, any waiver or consent by the Holder of such Note or by the Trustee with respect to any provisions thereof or of the Indenture, the obtaining of any judgment against the Issuer or any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.
Each of the Guarantors hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or any of the Holders protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest in or other Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Issuer or any other Person or any collateral, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest or notice with respect to such Note or the Indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Note Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Note except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Note and in this Note Guarantee.
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that, in the event of a default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest (including Additional Amounts, if any) on such Note, whether at its Stated Maturity, by acceleration, call for redemption, purchase or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted by the Trustee on behalf of, or by, the Holder of such Note, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, directly against each of the Guarantors to enforce this Note Guarantee without first
C-1
proceeding against the Issuer.
Each Guarantor agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or any of the Holders is prevented by applicable law from exercising its respective rights to accelerate the maturity of the Notes, to collect interest on the Notes, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to the Notes, or the Trustee or the Holders are prevented from taking any action to realize on any collateral, such Guarantor agrees to pay to the Trustee for the account of the Holders, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Trustee or any of the Holders.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note Guarantee or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the Note Guarantee of any Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, of the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (including Additional Amounts, if any) on the Note upon which this Note Guarantee is endorsed.
This Note Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Issuer for liquidation or reorganization, or equivalent proceeding under applicable law, should the Issuer become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Issuer’s assets, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable law, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Notes is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Notes whether as a voidable preference, fraudulent transfer, or as otherwise provided under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or under applicable laws of the jurisdiction of formation of the Issuer, all as though such payment or performance had not been made.
The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under this Note Guarantee.
The Guarantors or any particular Guarantor shall be released from this Note Guarantee upon the terms and subject to certain conditions provided in the Indenture.
By delivery of a supplemental indenture to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the execution of a Guarantee Agreement, each Person that becomes, or assumes the obligations of, a Guarantor after the date of the Indenture will be deemed to have executed and delivered this Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holder of this Note with the same effect as if such Guarantor were named below.
All terms used in this Note Guarantee which are defined in the Indenture referred to in the Note upon which this Note Guarantee is endorsed shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.
C-2
This Note Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Note upon which this Note Guarantee is endorsed shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture by manual signature.
Each Note Guarantee (other than that of the Company) will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Note Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or under applicable law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Guarantor.
In the case of Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH (“FMCD”), the following provisions apply:
(i)            Without limiting the agreements set forth in Section 11.8 of the Indenture, this Note Guarantee of FMCD will be limited if and to the extent payment under such Note Guarantee or the application of enforcement proceeds would cause (x) FMCD’s net assets (Reinvermögen - calculated as the sum of the balance sheet positions shown under § 266(2)(A), (B) and (C) German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)) less the sum of the liabilities (shown under the balance sheet positions pursuant to § 266(3)(B), (C) and (D) German Commercial Code) to fall below FMCD’s registered share capital (Stammkapital) or (y) (if the amount of the net assets is already an amount less than the registered share capital) cause such amount to be further reduced and, in either case, thereby affecting the assets required for the obligatory preservation of its registered share capital according to section 30, 31 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) (such event a “Capital Impairment”).
For the purposes of calculating the Capital Impairment, the following adjustments will be made:  (x) the amount of any increase of the registered share capital out of retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) after the Closing Date that has been effected without the prior consent of the Trustee shall be deducted from the registered share capital; and (y) liabilities incurred in violation of the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture shall be disregarded.
In the event FMCD’s net assets fall below its registered share capital, FMCD, upon request of the Trustee will realize in due course, to the extent legally permitted, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets if the relevant assets are not necessary for FMCD’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendiges Vermögen).
The costs of such auditor’s determination shall be borne by FMCD.
The determination of the auditor shall be binding for FMCD, and the Holders (except for manifest error).
To the extent that any payment has been made under this Note Guarantee by FMCD that would be necessary for FMCD to be able to cure any Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment such payment shall immediately — upon
C-3
FMCD’s demand — be returned to FMCD by any person receiving such payment, provided, however, in no event shall the Trustee or Paying Agent have any responsibility or liability for the return of any amount distributed to any Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes by the Trustee or Paying Agent, including, without limitation, any obligation to seek return of such amounts from such Holder or beneficial owner.
The burden of demonstration and proof (Darlegungs- und Beweislast) regarding the Capital Impairment and the maximum amount payable under this Note Guarantee shall remain with FMCD.
(iv)          The maximum amount payable under the guarantee shall be limited to the extent and as long as FMCD as a consequence of the payment would become unable to pay its debts when due (zahlungsunfähig) within the meaning of section 64 GmbHG (such event a “Liquidity Impairment”).
For the purpose of establishing whether a Liquidity Impairment would occur, payments made by FMCD after the Trustee has notified FMCD of its intention to enforce this Note Guarantee with respect to payment obligations that are not due at the time of the payment shall be disregarded, unless the Trustee has consented to such payments (at the direction of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding).
From the time the Trustee has notified FMCD and the Company of its intention to enforce this Note Guarantee, the Company may not make any payment demands against FMCD under shareholder loans and all such payment obligations of FMCD towards the Company shall be deferred, subordinated or waived as the Company sees fit, until the Trustee notifies FMCD that it is no longer enforcing this Note Guarantee or the Trustee consents (at the direction of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to the payments to be made to the Company.
(v)           The limitations as to the Capital Impairment shall not apply to the extent FMCD has an adequate compensation claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) against the Company that compensates for any loss incurred due to any payment by FMCD under this Note Guarantee.
The limitations in the preceding paragraphs (i) through (v), inclusive, shall apply mutatis mutandis to the direct and indirect shareholders of FMCD (other than the Company) if and to the extent the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees constitutes a payment (Auszahlung) by the relevant shareholders of FMCD within the meaning of section 30 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG).
The obligations of each Guarantor to the Holders of the Notes and to the Trustee pursuant to this Note Guarantee and the Indenture are expressly set forth in Article X of the Indenture
C-4
and reference is made to Article X of the Indenture for further provisions with respect to this Note Guarantee.
