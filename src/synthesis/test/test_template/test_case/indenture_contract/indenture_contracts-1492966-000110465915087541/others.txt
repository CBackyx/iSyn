(b)                                 assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from any such Person,
in each case, whether or not such Debt was Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, or to finance, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition, as the case may be.
Acquired Debt will be deemed to be Incurred on the date the acquired Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (or is merged into or consolidated with the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) or the date of the related acquisition of assets from any Person.
“Acquisition” means the acquisition by the Parent Guarantor of a portfolio of six schools from Meritas, LLC and certain of its Affiliates pursuant to the Meritas Transaction Agreement.
“Acquisition Closing Date” means the closing date of the Acquisition pursuant to the Meritas Transaction Agreement.
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement” means (a) any additional intercreditor agreement to be entered into by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of any Additional Notes, the Issuer and each Guarantor in connection with the issuance of Additional Notes or (b) any additional intercreditor agreement to be entered into by the representative on behalf of such holders of Debt that is permitted to share in the Collateral.

(b)                                 any other Person that owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of such specified Person’s Capital Stock or any officer or director of any such specified Person; or
(c)                                  any other Person 10% or more of the Voting Stock of which is beneficially owned or held, directly or indirectly by such specified Person.
For the purposes of this definition, “control,” when used with respect to any specified Person, means the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms “controlling” and “controlled” have meanings correlative to the foregoing.
“Agent” means any Registrar, co-registrar, Transfer Agent, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent or additional paying agent.
“Applicable Procedures” means, with respect to any transfer or exchange of or for Book-Entry Interests in any Global Note, the rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream that apply to such transfer or exchange.
“Applicable Redemption Premium” means, with respect to any Note on any redemption date, the greater of:

(ii)                                  the outstanding principal amount of the Note.
For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Applicable Redemption Premium will not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee or any Paying Agent.
“Asset Sale” means any sale, issuance, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition (including, without limitation, by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or Sale and Leaseback Transaction) by the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary (collectively, a “transfer”), directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, of:

(b)                                 all or substantially all of the properties and assets of any division or line of business of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(h)           General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges.
(2)           No service charge will be made by the Issuer or the Registrar to a Holder of a Book-Entry Interest in a Global Note, a Holder of a Global Note or a Holder of a Definitive Note for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve, documentary or other similar tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.06, 4.10 and 4.14 hereof).

(4)           All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive Notes will be the valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Any such transfer will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.
(6)           The Trustee, any Agent and the Issuer may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, or interest, if any, on such Notes and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Issuer will be affected by notice to the contrary nor liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.
42
Section 2.07          Replacement Notes.
If required by the Trustee or the Issuer, an indemnity bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, any Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced.
The Issuer may charge the Holder for its expenses in replacing a Note, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Note, as the case may be.
(b)           Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Issuer and will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
Section 2.08          Outstanding Notes.
The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding.
Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer holds the Note; however, Notes held by the Issuer or a Subsidiary of the Issuer will not be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of Section 3.07(a) hereof.
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser.
If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.
If a Paying Agent (other than the Issuer, a Subsidiary of the Issuer or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a redemption date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes will be deemed to be no longer outstanding and will cease to accrue interest.
Section 2.09          Treasury Notes.
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer or any Guarantor, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any Guarantor, will be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that the Trustee knows are so owned will be so disregarded.
Section 2.10          Temporary Notes.
Temporary Notes will be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Issuer considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as may be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
43
Holders of temporary Notes will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture.
The Trustee, or at the direction of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent (other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary of the Issuer) and no one else will cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and will destroy canceled Notes (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act).
Section 2.12          Defaulted Interest.
Section 2.13          Further Issues.
(a)           Subject to compliance with Section 4.09 hereof, the Issuer may from time to time issue Additional Notes ranking pari passu with the Initial Notes and with the same terms as to status, redemption and otherwise as such Notes (save for payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such Additional Notes or for the first payment of interest following the issue date of such Additional Notes).
Any Additional Notes, the Initial Notes and any previously issued Additional Notes will be consolidated and treated as a single class for all purposes under this Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase except as otherwise specified with respect to each series of Notes.
Section 2.14          ISIN or Common Code Number.
The Issuer in issuing the Notes may use an “ISIN” or “Common Code” number and, if so, such ISIN or Common Code number will be included in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; provided, however, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the ISIN or Common Code number printed in the notice or on the Notes, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption or exchange will not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
In addition, in order for any Additional Notes to have the same Common Code or ISIN, as applicable, as the Notes, such Additional Notes must be fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
44
Section 2.15          Deposit of Moneys.
Section 2.16          Agents.

63
(c)           For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, in the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (2) through (21) of Section 4.09(b) hereof, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.09(a) hereof, the Parent Guarantor in its sole discretion will be permitted to classify (and divide) such item of Debt on the date of its Incurrence in any manner that complies with this Section 4.09.
Debt under the Credit Agreement Incurred on or prior to the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred in reliance on the exception provided by Section 4.09(b)(1) hereof and such Debt may not be reclassified.
In addition, any item of Debt initially classified as Incurred pursuant to one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (2) through (21) of Section 4.09(b) hereof or entitled to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.09(a) hereof, may later be reclassified (and divided) by the Parent Guarantor in its sole discretion such that it will be deemed as having been Incurred pursuant to such new clause or clauses or Section 4.09(a) hereof to the extent that such reclassified Debt could be Incurred pursuant to such new clause or clauses or Section 4.09(a) hereof at the time of such reclassification.
(d)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Debt that the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies.
(e)                 (1)           Obligations in the form of letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Debt otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount;
(2)           any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in Section 4.12 hereof; and
(3)           accrual of interest or Preferred Stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Debt in the form of additional Debt with substantially equivalent terms, the reclassification of Preferred Stock as Debt due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock,
will not, in any case, be treated as Debt that is subject to this Section 4.09 hereof; provided, in each such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion, amortization, payment or reclassification is included in the Consolidated Interest Expense of the Parent Guarantor as accrued, and provided further, that with respect to clause (e)(3) above (except with respect to accrual of interest and Preferred Stock dividends), the amount of any such accrual, accretion, amortization, payment or reclassification will be included as Debt for purposes of determining the amount of Debt outstanding for the Incurrence of additional Debt.
(f)            For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, the principal amount of Debt issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in conformity with IFRS.
(g)           The Issuer will not Incur any Debt (including Permitted Debt) that is subordinated in right of payment to any other Debt of the Issuer unless such Debt is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Debt will be deemed to be subordinated in right of payment to any other Debt of the Issuer solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior Lien basis.
(h)           The Guarantors will not Incur any Debt (including Permitted Debt) that is subordinated in right of payment to any Debt of the Guarantors unless such Debt is also contractually
64
subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantees on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Debt will be deemed to be subordinated in right of payment to any other Debt of a Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior Lien basis.
Section 4.10          Limitation on Asset Sales.
(a)           The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale unless:
(1)           the consideration the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries receives for such Asset Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold;
(2)           at least 75% of the consideration the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiaries receive in respect of such Asset Sale consists of:
(A)          cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash within 90 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Sale);
(B)          Cash Equivalents (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash within 90 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Sale);
(C)          the assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Parent Guarantor’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which neither the Parent Guarantor nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such Debt or (y) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, if the Parent Guarantor and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;
(D)          Replacement Assets;
(F)           any combination of the consideration specified in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E); and
65
The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this Section 4.10(b) constitutes “Excess Proceeds.”
To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture.
Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.
If the Issuer is required to make an Asset Sale Offer or Notes Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirements of any applicable securities exchange on which Notes are then listed.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
66
regulations conflict with Sections 3.10 or 4.10 hereof, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws and regulations and will not by virtue thereof be deemed to have breached its obligations under Sections 3.10 or 4.10 hereof.
Section 4.11          Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.
(a)           The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase, exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service), with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor having a value greater than US$2,000,000 (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof), unless such transaction or series of transactions is entered into in good faith and:
(1)           such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could have been obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction with third parties that are not Affiliates of the Parent Guarantor;
(b)           The restrictions set forth in Section 4.11(a) hereof will not apply to:
(1)           customary directors’ fees, indemnities and similar arrangements (including the payment of directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums), consulting fees, employee compensation, employee and director bonuses, employment agreements and arrangements or employee benefit arrangements, including stock options or legal fees;
(2)           any Restricted Payment not prohibited by Section 4.07 hereof;
(4)           agreements and arrangements existing on the Issue Date and any amendment, extension, renewal, refinancing, modification or supplement thereto; provided that any such amendment, extension, renewal, refinancing, modification or supplement to the terms thereof is not more disadvantageous, taken as a whole, to the Holders and to the
67
Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any material respect than the original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date;
(5)           the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or similar transfers pursuant to, or for the purpose of the funding of, employment arrangements, stock options, stock ownership plans and other similar arrangements, as long as the terms thereof are or have been previously approved by the Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors;
(6)           transactions between or among the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;
(7)           any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) of the Parent Guarantor, options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock;
(8)           the existence of, or the performance by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of, any stockholders’ or joint venture agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement relating thereto) to which it is a party as of the Issue Date; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of, obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (8) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not more disadvantageous to the Holders when taken as a whole in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;
(9)           any transaction with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor, solely because the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock in or otherwise controls such Person or has the right to designate one or more members of the Board of Directors or similar governing body of such Person;
(10)         transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture that are fair to the Parent Guarantor or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person; and
(11)         any Permitted Investment (other than a Permitted Investment as defined in clause (c)(iii) or (r) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” herein).
Section 4.12          Limitation on Liens.
(a)           The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume, affirm or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind upon any property or assets of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary, including any shares of stock or intercompany notes or other Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary, owned on the date of this Indenture or acquired after the date of this Indenture, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, except:
(1)           in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, Permitted Liens; provided, however, that the Parent Guarantor and any such Restricted Subsidiary may only place Permitted Ordinary Course Liens on Non-Guarantor Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary may place a Lien on any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (i) even if
68
such Lien is not a Permitted Lien or (ii) in the case of Non-Guarantor Shares, even if such Lien is not a Permitted Ordinary Course Lien, if the Notes (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably or on a prior basis with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien; and
(2)           in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens; provided that no such Permitted Collateral Lien (except for Liens permitted under clause (b) or (c) of the definition thereof) will be granted unless such assets or property also secure the Notes.
(b)           Any Lien arising as a result of Section 4.12(a)(1) hereof will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with (i) the unconditional release of the Lien that gave rise to such Lien (other than as a consequence of an enforcement action with respect to the assets subject to such Lien) or (ii) as set forth in Section 10.02 hereof.
Section 4.13          Corporate Existence.
Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Issuer shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect:
(1)           its corporate existence, and the corporate, partnership or other existence of each of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary; and
(2)           the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes.
Section 4.14          Offer to Repurchase Upon Change of Control.
(1)           that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.14 and that all Notes tendered will be accepted for payment;
(3)           that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
69
(b)           The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this Section 4.14, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 4.14 by virtue of such compliance.
70
(e)           The provisions of this Section 4.14 that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of this Indenture are applicable.
(f)            The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.14, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
Section 4.15          Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.
(a)           The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction with respect to any property or assets (whether now owned or hereafter acquired), unless:
(1)           Section 4.10 hereof is complied with, including the provisions concerning the application of Net Cash Proceeds (treating all of the net consideration received in such Sale and Leaseback Transaction as Net Cash Proceeds for the purposes of Section 4.10 hereof);
(2)           to the extent the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, would Incur Debt as a result of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction, it would be permitted to Incur Debt under Section 4.09 hereof in the amount of the Attributable Debt Incurred in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction; and
(3)           to the extent the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, would Incur Debt as a result of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction, it would be permitted to grant a Lien to secure Debt under Section 4.12 hereof in the amount of the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall prevent the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary from engaging in a Sale and Leaseback Transaction solely between the Parent Guarantor and any Restricted Subsidiary or solely between or among Restricted Subsidiaries.
Section 4.16          Limitation on Issuances and Sales of Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries.
(a)           The Parent Guarantor will not sell or otherwise dispose of, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary (other than as permitted under Section 4.12 hereof), directly or indirectly, to issue or sell, any shares of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary (including options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of such Capital Stock).
(b)           Section 4.16(a) hereof will not apply to:

(3)           any issuance or sale of shares of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary made in compliance with Section 4.10 hereof;
(4)           any issuance or sale of shares of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary if, immediately after giving effect to such issuance or sale, such Restricted Subsidiary would no longer constitute a Restricted Subsidiary and any remaining Investment in such Person would have been permitted to be made under Section 4.07 hereof if made on the date of such issuance or sale; or
(5)           Capital Stock issued by a Person prior to the time:
(A)          such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;
(B)          such Person consolidates or merges with or into a Restricted Subsidiary; or
(C)          a Restricted Subsidiary consolidates or merges with or into such Person;
but only if such Capital Stock was not issued or Incurred by such Person in anticipation of it becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.
(c)           The Parent Guarantor shall continue to hold, directly or indirectly, 100% of the Capital Stock of the Issuer.
Section 4.17          Limitation on Guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries.
The Parent Guarantor will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any Debt of the Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor (other than the Notes), unless:
(B)          with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee will be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee with respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Debt is subordinated to the Notes; and
72
(2)           to the maximum extent permitted by law, such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee.
(b)           Section 4.17(a) hereof will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary:
(1)           guaranteeing Debt existing on the Issue Date;
(2)           that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;
(3)           arising solely due to the granting of a Permitted Lien that would not otherwise constitute a guarantee of Debt of the Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor; or
(4)           given to a bank or trust company incorporated in any member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union or any commercial banking institution (or any branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) in each case having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than €500,000,000, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for the Parent Guarantor’s benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary.
(c)           Notwithstanding Sections 4.17(a) and (b) hereof, any Guarantee of the Notes created pursuant to the provisions described in Section 4.17(a) hereof may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:
(1)           any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person who is not the Parent Guarantor’s Affiliate, of all of the Capital Stock owned by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited by this Indenture); or
(2)           (with respect to any Guarantee created after the Issue Date) the release by the holders of the Parent Guarantor’s or the Guarantor’s Debt described in paragraph 4.17(a) hereof, of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Debt other than as a result of payment under such guarantee), at a time when:
(A)          no other Debt of the Parent Guarantor (other than the Notes) or any Guarantor (other than the Guarantees) has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or
(B)          the holders of all such other Debt that is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Debt other than as a result of payment under such guarantee); or

73
(d)           Notwithstanding Sections 4.17(a) through 4.17(c) hereof, the Parent Guarantor will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent such Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:
(1)           any conflict with or violation of applicable law;
(2)           risk of personal or criminal liability for the officers, directors, shareholders or partners of such Restricted Subsidiary;
(3)           any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any reasonable guarantee or similar fee payable to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than reasonable expenses and other than reasonable governmental expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to Section 4.17(d)(1) undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee; or
(4)           breach of, or any termination event under, any existing material contract (and any amendment, modification or supplement thereto) of such Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors of such Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent Guarantor.
Section 4.18          Payments for Consent.
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in any documents distributed relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries will be permitted, in connection with any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, to exclude any Holder, or to offer and pay different consideration to any Holder for, or as an inducement to, any such consent, waiver or amendment, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Holder is in any jurisdiction where:
(a)           (1) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment in the manner deemed appropriate by the Parent Guarantor, (2) the payment of the consideration therefor or (3) the conduct or completion of a related offer to purchase or exchange the Notes for cash or other securities in the manner deemed appropriate by the Parent Guarantor would require the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to (A) file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document or subject the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to ongoing periodic reporting or similar requirements under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Parent Guarantor in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome, (B) qualify as a foreign corporation or other entity or as a dealer in securities in such jurisdiction if it is not otherwise required to so qualify, (C) generally consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction or (D) subject itself or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so subject; or
(b)           such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

Section 4.19          Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries.
(a)           The Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly established Subsidiaries, but excluding the Issuer, which must remain a Restricted Subsidiary) to be an “Unrestricted Subsidiary,” provided that:
(1)           such designation would not cause a Default;
(2)           the Parent Guarantor would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to Section 4.07 hereof in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Parent Guarantor’s interest in such Subsidiary;
(3)           such Subsidiary does not own any Capital Stock, Redeemable Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any property or assets of, or have any Investment in, the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
(4)           such Subsidiary is not liable, directly or indirectly, with respect to any Debt, Lien or other obligation that, if in default, would result (with the passage of time or giving of notice or otherwise) in a default on any of the Parent Guarantor’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that an Unrestricted Subsidiary may provide a Guarantee for the Notes;
(5)           such Subsidiary, either alone or in the aggregate with all other Unrestricted Subsidiaries, does not operate, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the businesses of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries;
(6)           such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither the Parent Guarantor nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any direct or indirect obligation to:
(B)          maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or to cause such Person to achieve any specified levels of operating results; and
(7)           neither the Parent Guarantor nor any Restricted Subsidiary directly or indirectly guarantees, is liable for or provides credit support for the Debt of such Subsidiary.
(b)           In the event of any such designation, the Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have made an Investment constituting a Restricted Payment pursuant to Section 4.07 hereof for all purposes of this Indenture in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Parent Guarantor’s interest in such Subsidiary.
(c)           The Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, provided that:
(1)           such designation would not cause a Default;
(2)           such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary will not have any Debt outstanding (other than Debt that would be Permitted Debt), immediately before and after giving effect to such proposed designation, or after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of any such Debt of such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Debt was Incurred on the date of its designation as a Restricted Subsidiary, the Parent Guarantor
75
(3)           any Lien on the property of such Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time of such designation which will be deemed to have been Incurred by such newly designated Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such designation would be permitted to be Incurred by the covenant described under Section 4.12 hereof.
(d)           Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Parent Guarantor’s Board of Directors with the Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the conditions set forth in this Section 4.19, and giving the effective date of such designation.
Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal quarter in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made during the last fiscal quarter of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).
Section 4.20          Maintenance of Listing.
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange for trading on its Global Exchange Market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided, that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange, and thereafter use its best efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.
Section 4.21  Impairment of Security Interest.
(a)           Subject to Sections 4.21(b) and (c) below, the Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly omit to take, any action, which action of omission would have the result of materially impairing any security interest over any of the assets comprising the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens will not be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to any Collateral) for the benefit of the Holders (including the priority thereof).
(b)           At the direction of the Parent Guarantor and without the consent of the Holders, the Trustee and the applicable Collateral Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (A) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (B) provide for any Permitted Collateral Liens; (C) add to the Collateral or (D) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or renewal, the Parent Guarantor delivers to the Trustee, any of:
(1)           a solvency opinion, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement;
76
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement; or
(3)           an Opinion of Counsel, in form satisfactory to the Trustee confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents as so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced remain valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.
(c)           Nothing in this Section 4.21 will restrict the release or replacement of any security interests in compliance with the provisions set out in Section 10.02 hereof.
(d)           In the event that the Parent Guarantor complies with this Section 4.21, the Trustee and/or the applicable Collateral Agent (as the case may be) will consent to any such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the need for instructions from the Holders; provided such amendments do not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under this Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
Section 4.22          Additional Amounts.
(a)           All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or other governmental charges and any interest, penalties and other liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, “Taxes”), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof.
If any withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor is organized, engaged in business or resident for tax purposes, or from or through which payment under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees is made by or on behalf of the Issuer, or any political subdivision or authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required to be made from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder of the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts) will equal the amount that such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.
(1)           any Taxes that would not have been imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction but for the Holder’s present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or a present or former connection between the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Holder if such Holder is an estate, a trust, partnership, limited liability company or a corporation), including, but not limited to, citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile or existence of a business, permanent establishment, dependent agent, place of business or place of management present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, other than the mere receipt or holding of any Note or Guarantee or by reason of the receipt of payments thereunder or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, such Guarantee or this Indenture;
77
(2)           any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner of any Note, to timely comply with a written request of the Issuer, addressed to the Holder at least 60 calendar days prior to the relevant date on which a payment under the Notes is due and payable, to comply (to the extent it is legally entitled to) with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirement concerning nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to an exemption from, or a reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);
(3)           any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
(4)           any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect to any Note or Guarantee;
(6)           any withholding or deduction in respect of any Taxes where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any Directive otherwise implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meetings of November 26 and 27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, any such Directive;
(7)           any Tax that is required to be withheld or deducted from a payment made to a Holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting a Note for a payment (where presentation is required) to another available paying agent in a member state of the European Union (unless such Notes could not have been presented for payment elsewhere);
(8)           any Tax that is imposed on or with respect to any payment made to any Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or an entity that is not the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note; or
(9)           any withholding Tax imposed by the United States or a political subdivision thereof.
In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect or on account of any combination of the above items (1) through (9).
No Additional Amounts will be required to be paid for any tax, assessment, withholding or deduction required by sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“FATCA”), any current or future Treasury Regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder, any law, regulation or other official guidance enacted in any jurisdiction implementing FATCA, any
78
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction to implement FATCA, or any agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service under FATCA.
(c)           The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of Taxes as required by, and remit the full amount of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with, all applicable laws.
The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on such Officers’ Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
(e)           In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will pay and (without duplication) indemnify the Holders for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer, documentation, court, excise, property or other similar Taxes imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the execution, delivery, registration, enforcement, redemption or retirement of, or the receipt of any Payment under or with respect to, the Notes, this Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (limited, solely in the case of Taxes with respect to the receipt of any Payment, to any such taxes other than those imposed under FATCA or described under (a) through (c) and (e) through (g) and any combination of any of the foregoing.
(f)            The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture (and any transfer of a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes) and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor is organized, engaged in business or resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
(g)           Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal (and premium, if any), a redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note (including payments thereof made pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for in this Indenture to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
Section 4.23          Collateral.
Such future pledges of such Capital Stock shall be deemed to constitute Collateral.
79
(b)           The Parent Guarantor will, and will procure that each Guarantor will, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as each Collateral Agent may reasonably require (i) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents; and (ii) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in each Collateral Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets.
(c)           Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.23 to the contrary, the Parent Guarantor is not obligated to cause the Capital Stock of a Guarantor to be pledged so long as the pledge of such Capital Stock (i) could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a breach of, or any termination event under, any existing material contract of such Guarantor in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor or such Guarantor or (ii) would not be recognized as enforceable under the laws of the jurisdiction where such Guarantor is organized.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Capital Stock of British International School LLC and Nord Anglia International School L.L.C., organized under the laws of the United Arab Emirates, will not be pledged.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no current or future Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor that is or becomes, and in each case remains, a Controlled Foreign Corporation (as defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) (or any subsidiary owned by any such Controlled Foreign Corporation) or a Subsidiary that has no material assets other than equity or debt interest in such Controlled Foreign Corporation shall be required to give a guarantee or pledge any of its assets (including shares in a Subsidiary) as security for an obligation (as guarantor or otherwise) of a ‘‘United States person’’ (as defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended).
Furthermore, not more than 65% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote of any such Subsidiary may be pledged directly or indirectly as security for an obligation (as guarantor or otherwise) of a ‘‘United States person.
Section 4.24          Additional Intercreditor Agreements.
(a)           At the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence of any Debt that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Trustee and the Collateral Agents will enter into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement or an accession or amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement (which accession or amendment does not adversely affect the rights of the Holders), in each case without the consent of any Holder; provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or either Collateral Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under this Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
(b)           Each Holder, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of each such Intercreditor Agreement, Additional Intercreditor Agreement or accession or amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement, and neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agents shall be required to seek the consent of any Holders to perform their respective obligations under and in accordance with this covenant.
Section 4.25          Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.
80
4.11, Section 4.17,  the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.16, Section 4.15 and Section 5.02(a)(3) (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”), and, in each case, any related default provision of this Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
(b)           The Suspended Covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect.
Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent Guarantor properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and Section 4.07 will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of such Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended.
On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Parent Guarantor’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to Section 4.09(a) or Section 4.09(b) (to the extent such Debt would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Debt Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date).
To the extent such Debt would not be so permitted to be incurred under Section 4.09(a) or Section 4.09(b) such Debt will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under Section 4.09(b)(3).
The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of such event.
Section 4.26          Post-Closing Collateral and Guarantees.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding.
A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default will not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default.
All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
Section 6.04          Waiver of Past Defaults.
Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(a)           the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have made a written request and offered an indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee under the Notes and this Indenture,
Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
Section 6.07          Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, will not be impaired or affected without the consent of at least 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes; provided that a Holder will not have the right to institute any such suit for the enforcement of payment if and to the extent that the institution or prosecution thereof or the entry of judgment therein would, under applicable law, result in the surrender, impairment, waiver or loss of the Lien of this Indenture upon any property subject to such Lien.

If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or Section 6.01(b) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuer for the whole amount of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, remaining unpaid on, the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, Additional Amounts, interest and such further amount as will be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Notes, their creditors or property and will be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
88
and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee will consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.06 hereof.
To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.06 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, will be denied for any reason, payment of the same will be secured by a Lien on, and will be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
Nothing herein contained will be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Section 6.10          Priorities.
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if the Trustee or the Security Agent collects any money pursuant to this Article 6 or from the enforcement of any Security Document, it will pay out (or in the case of a Collateral Agent, it will pay to the Trustee to pay out) the money in the following order:
First:      to the Trustee, the Agents and their respective agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.06 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expenses and liabilities Incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the Agents and the costs and expenses of collection;
Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, respectively; and
Third:     to the Issuer, any Guarantor or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction will direct.
Section 6.11          Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.
This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.
Section 6.12          Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined in a final judgment adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders will be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter
89
all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders will continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 6.13          Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes in Section 2.07 hereof, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy will, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.
The assertion of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, will not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default will impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.
Every right and remedy given by this Article 6 or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
ARTICLE 7
TRUSTEE

(a)           If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs.
(b)           Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(1)           the duties of the Trustee and the Agents will be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture and the Trustee and the Agents need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations will be read into this Indenture against the Trustee or the Agents; and
(2)           in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely without liability, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture.

(g)            The Trustee will have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any of the provisions in this Indenture or the financial performance of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and shall be entitled to assume that the Issuer and the Guarantors are in compliance with all the provisions of this Indenture unless notified to the contrary in writing.
(h)           Unless the Trustee receives prior written notice from the Issuer, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume, without any further inquiry, that the Issuer has duly performed all of its obligations in accordance with this Indenture, including each of the exhibits attached hereto.
Section 7.02          Rights of Trustee.
(a)           The Trustee may conclusively rely upon, without liability, any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person.
The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
(b)           Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers’ Certificate and/or an Opinion of Counsel or both.
The Trustee will not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers’ Certificate and/or Opinion of Counsel.

(g)           In no event shall the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind (including, but
91
not limited to, loss of profit), regardless of whether the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage or the form of action.
(h)           Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably waives, in favor of the Trustee and the Agents, any conflict of interest that may arise by virtue of the Trustee and/or the Agents acting in various capacities under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or this Indenture or for other customers of the Trustee and the Agents.
Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors acknowledge that the Trustee and the Agents and their respective affiliates (together, the “Agent Parties”) may have interests in, or may be providing or may in the future provide financial or other services to other parties with interests which the Issuer and the Guarantors may regard as conflicting with its interests and may possess information (whether or not material to the Issuer and the Guarantors) other than as a result of the Trustee and/or the Agents acting as the Trustee and/or the Agents hereunder, that the Trustee and/or the Agents may not be entitled to share with the Issuer and/or the Guarantors.
The Trustee and the Agents will not disclose confidential information obtained from the Issuer and the Guarantors (without its consent) to any of the Trustee and/or the Agent’s other customers or affiliates nor will it use on the Issuer and the Guarantors’ behalf any confidential information obtained from any other customer.
Without prejudice to the foregoing, each of the Issuer and the Guarantors agree that the Agent Parties may deal (whether for its own or its customers’ account) in, or advise on, securities of any party and that such dealing or giving of advice, will not constitute a conflict of interest for the purposes of the Notes, the Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or this Indenture.
(i)            The Trustee shall treat information provided hereunder as confidential, but (unless consent is prohibited by law) each of the Issuer and the Guarantors hereby consent to the transfer and disclosure by the Trustee of any information relating to it provided hereunder to and between branches, subsidiaries, representative offices, affiliates and agents of the Trustee in connection with the discharge of the Trustee’s trusts, powers, authorities, duties and obligations under this Indenture, wherever situated, for confidential use (including to service providers selected by the Trustee with due care for data processing, statistical and risk analysis purposes only).
The Trustee and any such branch, subsidiary, representative office, affiliate, or agent may transfer and disclose any such information as required by any applicable law, regulatory authority or legal process.
(j)            Notwithstanding anything else herein contained, the Trustee and the Agents may refrain without liability from doing anything that would or might in its opinion be contrary to any law of any state or jurisdiction (including but not limited to the laws of Hong Kong, Germany, the United States of America or any jurisdiction forming a part of it and England & Wales) or any directive or regulation of any agency of any such state or jurisdiction and may without liability do anything which is, in its opinion, necessary to comply with any such law, directive or regulation.
(k)           The Trustee may refrain from taking any action in any jurisdiction if the taking of such action in that jurisdiction would, in its opinion based upon legal advice in the relevant jurisdiction, be contrary to any law of that jurisdiction.
(l)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or in any other transaction document, the Trustee and the Agents shall not in any event be liable for any loss or damage, or any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder if it is prevented from so performing its obligations by any reason which is beyond the control of the Trustee and/or the Agents, including, but not limited to, any existing or future law or regulation, any existing or future act of governmental authority, act of God, flood, war whether declared or undeclared, epidemic, terrorism, riot, rebellion, civil commotion, strike, lockout, other industrial action, general failure of electricity or other supply, aircraft collision, technical failure, accidental or mechanical or electrical breakdown, computer failure or failure of any money transmission system or any event where performance of any duty or obligation under or pursuant to this Indenture would or may be illegal or would result in the Trustee and/or the Agents being in breach of any law, rule, regulation, or any decree, order or judgment of any court, or practice, request, direction, notice, announcement or similar action (whether or not having
92
the force of law) of any relevant government, government agency, regulatory authority, stock exchange or self-regulatory organization to which the Trustee or the Agents is subject.
(m)          If an Event of Default shall have occurred, or if the Trustee finds it expedient or necessary, or is requested by the Issuer to undertake duties which are of an exceptional nature or otherwise outside the scope of the Trustee’s normal duties under this Indenture, the Issuer will pay such additional remuneration as it and the Trustee may agree.
Section 7.03          Individual Rights of Trustee.
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties.
The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.09 and 7.10 hereof.
Section 7.04          Trustee’s Disclaimer.
The Trustee will not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or this Indenture) or the Security Documents, it will not be accountable for the Issuer’s use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money paid to the Issuer or upon the Issuer’s direction under any provision of this Indenture, it will not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it will not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.
Section 7.05          Notice of Defaults.
Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold notice if and as long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the best interests of Holders.
Section 7.06          Compensation and Indemnity.
The Trustee’s and the Agent’s compensation will not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.
The Issuer and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Trustee and the Agents promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for its services.
Such expenses will include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee’s and the Agent’s agents and counsel.
(b)           The Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the Trustee and the Agents against any and all losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by them arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Issuer and the Guarantors (including this Section 7.06) and defending themselves against any claim (whether asserted by the Issuer, the Guarantors, any Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable
93
to their gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.
Failure by the Trustee or the Agents to so notify the Issuer will not relieve the Issuer or any of the Guarantors of their obligations hereunder.
The Issuer or such Guarantor will defend the claim and the Trustee or the Agents will cooperate in the defense.
The Trustee or the Agents may have separate counsel and the Issuer will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.
Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor need pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
(c)           The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under this Section 7.06 will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
(d)           To secure the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations in this Section 7.06, the Trustee and the Agent will have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee and the Agent, except that held in trust to pay principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, particular Notes.
Such Lien will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
(e)           When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(k) or (l) hereof occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
Section 7.07          Replacement of Trustee.
(2)           the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
(3)           a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Issuer.
94
Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.07, the Issuer’s obligations under Section 7.06 hereof will continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
Section 7.08          Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.
If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act will be the successor Trustee.
There will at all times be a Trustee hereunder that is a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any state thereof that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trustee power, that is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least US$100,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.
Section 7.10          Agents.
Such successor Agent will become the Agent hereunder upon the resignation or removal date specified in such notice.
The reasonable costs and expenses (including its counsels’ reasonable fees and expenses) incurred by the Agent in connection with such proceeding will be paid by the Issuer.
Upon its resignation and delivery any funds, the Agent will be discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in connection with this Indenture, but will continue to enjoy the benefit of Section 7.06 hereof.
(b)           In acting under the Indenture and in connection with the Notes, the Paying Agent shall, based on the advice of a legal counsel or a tax advisor reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, be entitled to make a deduction or withholding from any payment which it makes under the Indenture for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, or similar charges if and to the extent so required by applicable law, in which event the Paying Agent shall make such payment after such withholding or deduction has been made (and Additional Amounts will be paid for any such withholding or deductions if and to the extent required under Section 4.22 of the Indenture) and shall account to the relevant authorities for the amount so withheld or deducted.
95
accordance with this sub-section (together with a copy of the opinion from the aforesaid legal counsel or tax advisor stating that such withholding or deduction is required by applicable law) and shall not make any such withholding or deduction unless the Issuer, after receiving such notice from the Paying Agent, fails to transfer the necessary Additional Amounts to it in accordance with Section 4.22 of the Indenture on or prior to the scheduled payment date.
(c)           The parties hereto agree that if any payments of interest or principal under the Notes become subject to U.S. withholding tax pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or other similar applicable legislation, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith and to provide and share such relevant and applicable information including any relevant changes to their tax status to the extent practicable and, if necessary, make such amendments or modifications to this agreement as are necessary to permit the parties to fulfill their withholding and reporting obligations thereunder, provided that the Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent shall not be obliged to identify whether such withholding is applicable or assist any other party in fulfilling its withholding and reporting obligations thereunder.
(d)           In acting under the Indenture and in connection with the Notes, the Agents are acting solely as agents of the Issuer and do not assume any fiduciary duty or other obligation towards, or have any relationship of agency or trust, for or with any person other than the Issuer.
(e)           Any funds held by the Agents are not held by the Agents as banker and are therefore not subject to the relevant United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority Client Money Rules.
(f)            The Agents shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken or thing suffered by them in reliance upon any advice or representation (whether made orally or in writing), Note, notice, direction, consent, certificate, affidavit, statement or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been presented or signed by the proper party or parties.
(g)           The Agents shall be entitled to refrain, without liability, from taking any action if they receive conflicting, unclear or equivocal instructions or in order to comply with any applicable law.
Section 8.01          Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers’ Certificate, elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes (including the Guarantees) upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8.
Section 8.02          Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Issuer’s exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes (including the Guarantees) on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, “Legal Defeasance”).
For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer and the Guarantors will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes (including the Guarantees), which will thereafter be deemed to be “outstanding” only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (1) and (2) below (it being understood that such Notes will not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes), and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such Notes, the Guarantees and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the
96
Issuer, will execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
(1)           the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to in Section 8.04 hereof;
(2)           the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;
(3)           the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, and the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and
Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Issuer may exercise its option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.03 hereof.
Section 8.03          Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Issuer’s exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from each of their obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, 4.19, 4.21, 4.23 and 4.24 hereof and clause (3) of Section 5.02(a) hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied (hereinafter, “Covenant Defeasance”), and the Notes will thereafter be deemed not “outstanding” for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but will continue to be deemed “outstanding” for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes will not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes).
For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes and Guarantees, the Issuer and the Guarantors may omit to comply with and will have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes and Guarantees will be unaffected thereby.
In addition, upon the Issuer’s exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (i) hereof will not constitute Events of Default.
Section 8.04          Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof:
(a)           the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in Swiss francs, non-callable Swiss Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
97
(A)          an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that:
(1)           the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or
(2)           since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law,
in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; and
(d)           no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Debt), and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings);
(e)           such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture and the agreements governing any other Debt being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is a party or by which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is bound;
Section 8.05          Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all cash in Swiss francs and non-callable Swiss Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the “Trustee”) pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes will be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and
98
interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Issuer will pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or the non-callable Swiss Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.
Section 8.06          Repayment to Issuer.
Any money deposited with the Trustee (in trust) or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer (in trust) for the payment of the principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, has become due and payable will be paid to the Issuer on its request or (if then held by the Issuer) will be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note will thereafter be permitted to look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease.
Section 8.07          Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any Swiss francs or non-callable Swiss Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under this Indenture and the Notes and the Guarantees will be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer will be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

100
supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
Section 9.02          With Consent of Holders.
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Collateral Agents (as applicable) may amend or supplement this Indenture (including, without limitation, Section 3.10, Section 4.10 and Section 4.14 hereof), the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), and, subject to Section 6.04 and Section 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series will be required.
Upon the request of the Issuer accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee and the relevant Collateral Agent will join with the Issuer and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its absolute discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
Any failure of the Issuer to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.
Subject to Section 6.04 and Section 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Issuer with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
However, unless consented to by the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not:
(1)           change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of or Additional Amounts or interest on, any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause (a) of the definition thereof related thereto);
101
(2)           reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause (b) of the definition thereof related thereto);
(3)           change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional Amounts or the interest thereon is payable;
(4)           (i) change the date on which any Note may be redeemed pursuant to Article 3 or (ii) change any provision relating to the Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes pursuant to Section 3.09 hereof;
(5)           impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of any Note in accordance with the provisions of such Note, this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;
(6)           reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver of provisions of this Indenture requiring the consent of 90% of Holders of the Notes;
(7)           modify any of the provisions relating to supplemental indentures requiring the consent of 90% of Holders of the Notes;
(8)           release any Guarantee except in compliance with the terms of this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;
(9)           release any Lien on the Collateral granted for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, except in compliance with the terms of the Security Documents, Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or
(10)         make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
Any amendment, supplement or waiver consented to by at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will be binding against any non-consenting Holders.
Section 9.03          Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note.
An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
Section 9.04          Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
102
The Trustee and the Collateral Agents, as applicable, will sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Collateral Agents, as applicable.
The Issuer may not sign an amended or supplemental indenture until the Board of Directors of the Issuer approves it.
In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee and the Collateral Agents will be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) will be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Opinion of Counsel shall not be required in connection with the addition of a Guarantor under this Indenture upon execution and delivery of such Guarantor and the Trustee of a supplemental indenture in substantially the form attached as Exhibit E hereto.
ARTICLE 10
COLLATERAL AND SECURITY
Section 10.01       Security Documents.
Each Holder, by its acceptance thereof, consents and agrees to the terms of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of Collateral and authorizing each Collateral Agent to enter into any Security Document on its behalf) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms and authorizes and directs each Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance therewith.
The Parent Guarantor will, and will cause each of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or proper, or as may be required by the provisions of the Security Documents, to assure and confirm to the Trustee that the applicable Collateral Agent holds, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, duly created, enforceable and perfected Liens as contemplated hereby and by the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, so as to render the same available for the security and benefit of this Indenture and of the Notes and any Guarantee, according to the intent and purposes herein expressed.
The Issuer and any Guarantor will each take, and the Parent Guarantor will cause the Restricted Subsidiaries to take (including as may be requested by the Trustee) any and all actions reasonably required to cause the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement to create and maintain, as security for the Obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor hereunder, in respect of the Collateral, valid and enforceable perfected first-priority Liens in and on all the Collateral ranking in right and priority of payment as set forth in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and subject to no other Liens other than as permitted by the terms of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
(b)           Each of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders agree that each Collateral Agent will be the joint and several creditor (together with the Holders and the Trustee) of each and every obligation of the parties hereto under the Notes and this Indenture, and that accordingly each Collateral Agent will have its own independent right to demand performance by the Issuer and the Guarantors of those obligations, except that such demand will only be made with the prior written consent of the Trustee acting at the written direction of the Holders representing a majority of the
103
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes.
However, any discharge of such obligation to each Collateral Agent, on the one hand, or to the Trustee or the Holders, as applicable, on the other hand, will, to the same extent, discharge the corresponding obligation owing to the other.
(c)           Each Collateral Agent agrees that it will hold the security interests in Collateral created under the Security Documents to which it is a party as contemplated by this Indenture, and any and all proceeds thereof, for the benefit of, among others, the Trustee and the Holders, to act in preservation of the security interest in the Collateral.
Each Collateral Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders or the Trustee.
Subject to the preceding sentence, each Collateral Agent will take action or refrain from taking action in connection therewith only as directed by the Trustee.
(d)           Each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (i) to have authorized each Collateral Agent, as applicable, to enter into the relevant Security Documents and (ii) to be bound thereby.
Each Holder, by accepting a Note, appoints each Collateral Agent as its agent in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents and authorizes it to act on such Holder’s behalf.
The Trustee hereby acknowledges that each Collateral Agent is authorized to act under the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee, with the full authority and powers of the Trustee thereunder.
Each Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to exercise such rights, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to it by the terms of the Security Documents, including the power to enter into the Security Documents, as trustee on behalf of the Holders and the Trustee, together with all rights, powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto or necessary to give effect to the trusts created thereunder.
Subject to the requirement that it agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders or the Trustee, each Collateral Agent will be entitled to seek directions from the Trustee and will be obligated to follow those directions if given.
Each Collateral Agent hereby accepts its appointment as the agent of the Holders and the Trustee under the Security Documents, and its authorization to so act on such Holders’ and the Trustee’s behalf.
Section 10.02       Release of Collateral.
(a)           Collateral may be released from the Liens and security interests created by the Security Documents at any time or from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and this Indenture.
In addition, and subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, upon the request of the Issuer pursuant to an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel certifying that all conditions precedent hereunder have been met and at the sole cost and expense of the Issuer applicable Collateral Agent will authorize the release of Collateral from the security created by the Security Documents that is sold, conveyed or disposed of in compliance with the provisions of this Indenture.
Upon receipt of such Officers’ Certificate and Opinion of Counsel applicable Collateral Agent will execute, deliver or acknowledge any necessary or proper instruments of termination, satisfaction or release to evidence the release of any Collateral permitted to be released pursuant to this Indenture or the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
(b)           Each Collateral Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents.
Each of the releases set forth above will be effected by applicable Collateral Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.
104
Section 10.03       Authorization of Actions to Be Taken by the Trustee Under the Security Documents.
Upon reasonable request of the Trustee, but without any affirmative duty on the Trustee to do so, the Issuer and the Guarantors will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Indenture.
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 and 7.02 hereof and the terms of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of the Holders, direct, on behalf of the Holders, any Collateral Agent to take all actions it deems necessary or appropriate in order to:
(1)           enforce any of the terms of the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement; and
Subject to the provisions hereof, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee and/or the relevant Collateral Agent will have power to institute and maintain such suits and proceedings as it may deem expedient to prevent any impairment of the Collateral by any acts that may be unlawful or in violation of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or this Indenture, and such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may deem expedient to preserve or protect its interests and the interests of the Holders in the Collateral (including power to institute and maintain suits or proceedings to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any legislative or other governmental enactment, rule or order that may be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid if the enforcement of, or compliance with, such enactment, rule or order would impair the security interest hereunder or be prejudicial to the interests of the Holders or of the Trustee and/or the relevant Collateral Agent).
Section 10.04       Authorization of Receipt of Funds by the Trustee Under the Security Documents.
The Trustee and/or each Collateral Agent is authorized to receive any funds for the benefit of the Holders distributed under the Security Documents or Intercreditor Agreement, and to make further distributions of such funds to the Holders according to the provisions of this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Section 10.05       Termination of Security Interest.
(2)           as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

105
(4)           upon certain dispositions of the Collateral not prohibited by either Sections 4.10, 5.01 or 5.02 hereof (and in the latter instance, if such covenant authorizes such release);
(5)           in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of this Indenture; or
(6)           as described under Article 9 hereof.
ARTICLE 11

Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.
Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
(b)           The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuer, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.
Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture.
(c)           If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Issuer or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full force and effect.
(d)           Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.

guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee.
The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
Section 11.02       Limitation on Guarantor Liability.
(a)           Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar national, federal, local or state law or voidable preference, financial assistance or improper corporate benefit, or violate the corporate purpose of the relevant Guarantor or any applicable capital maintenance or similar laws or regulations affecting the rights of creditors generally under any applicable law or regulation to the extent applicable to any Guarantee.
To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 11, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting either a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or voidable preference, financial assistance or improper corporate benefit, or violating the corporate purpose of the relevant Guarantor or any applicable capital maintenance or similar laws or regulations affecting the rights of creditors generally under any applicable law or regulation.
(b)           Limitation for Certain U.S. Guarantors.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no current or future Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor that is or becomes, and in each case remains, a Controlled Foreign Corporation (as defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) (or any subsidiary owned by any such Controlled Foreign Corporation) or a Subsidiary that has no material assets other than equity or debt interest in such Controlled Foreign Corporation shall be required to give a guarantee or pledge any of its assets (including shares in a Subsidiary) as security for an obligation (as guarantor or otherwise) of a “United States person” (as defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended).
Furthermore, not more than 65% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote of any such Subsidiary may be pledged directly or indirectly as security for an obligation (as guarantor or otherwise) of a “United States person.”
(c)           Limitations for Hungarian Guarantors.
(1)           The obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor formed under the laws of Hungary under this Article 11 shall at all times be limited to the maximum aggregate amount that does not result in any conflict with Hungarian laws applicable to foundations and such Guarantor’s deed of foundation.
The obligations and liabilities of any such Guarantor under this Article 11 may not:
(A)          threaten the performance of such Guarantor’s activities that serve the purposes stated in its deed of foundation or threaten the maintenance of its operation;
(B)          exceed in amount the value of such Guarantor’s assets;
107
(C)          threaten such Guarantor’s charitable activities or the status of such Guarantor as a charitable foundation.
(2)           Notwithstanding any term of this Article 11 or any other term in this Indenture, any guarantee or indemnity given by or other obligation assumed by such Guarantor is meant as and is to be interpreted as an abstract guarantee agreement and not as surety as regulated in Articles 6:416-6:426 of the Hungarian Civil Code (kezesség) and the Hungarian Guarantor undertakes to comply with the provisions of this clause.
(d)           Limitations for Polish Guarantors.
(1)           Any Guarantee granted or assumed by a Guarantor incorporated in Poland (a “Polish Guarantor”) shall be limited in accordance with the following rules:
(A)          To the extent the liability under this Indenture and/or the Notes is considered a liability (zobowiązanie) within the meaning of Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy and Rehabilitation Law of 28 February 2003 (Polish Journal of Laws No.
60, item 535, as amended) (as may be amended from time to time) (“Polish Bankruptcy Law”), the liability of each Polish Guarantor under this Indenture and/or the Notes shall be limited to the aggregate value of the assets of such Polish Guarantor current at the time less the aggregate value of its liabilities current at the time (other than the Polish Guarantor’s liability hereunder), and thus such liability should not result in the Polish Guarantor’s insolvency as defined in Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law;
(B)          In addition to the provisions of paragraph (A) above, each Polish Guarantor that is a limited liability company (Sp.
has the right to refrain from making a payment under this Indenture and/or the Notes in the event and to the extent that such payment would result in a reduction of its assets necessary to fully cover its registered share capital under Article 189 section 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code of 15 September 2000 (Kodeks spółek handlowych, Polish Journal of Laws No.
94, item 1037, as amended).
(2)           The limitation in Section 11.02(d)(1)(A) hereof will not apply if one or more of the following circumstances occurs:
(A)          any Event of Default is continuing, irrespective of whether such Event of Default occurs before or after the relevant Polish Guarantor becomes insolvent within the meaning of Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law;
(B)          the liabilities of the relevant Polish Guarantor (other than those under the Security Documents) result in its insolvency within the meaning of Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law; or
(C)          Polish law is amended in such a manner that over-indebtedness (stan nadmiernego zadłużenia) as provided for in Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law (as in force on the Closing Date) no longer gives grounds for bankruptcy or obliges the representatives of the Polish Guarantor to file for bankruptcy.
(3)           For the avoidance of doubt, any Guarantee, indemnity and other obligations of any guarantee granted or assumed by the Polish Guarantor under this Indenture and/or the Notes shall be treated as future obligations under condition precedent which is failure to pay when due of any amount guaranteed under this Indenture and/or the Notes.
108
(e)           Limitations for Spanish Guarantors:

(A)          S.L.s can only issue notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint and several guarantee from a credit institution and, to the extent that such restriction may also apply to S.L.s when guaranteeing notes, a similar restriction shall be applicable to the Guarantee granted by the Spanish Guarantors incorporated under the form of S.L.s.
(B)          S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee notes convertible into quotas (participaciones).
(f)            Limitations for Swiss Guarantors.

109
any security by the Swiss Guarantor or any restrictions of the Swiss Guarantor’s rights of set-off and/or subrogation or its duties to subordinate or waive claims and (ii) complying with such obligations would constitute a repayment of capital (Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by such Swiss Guarantor or would otherwise be restricted under Swiss corporate law then applicable (the “Restricted Obligations”), the aggregate liability of the Swiss Guarantor for Restricted Obligations shall be limited to the amount of freely distributable equity capital of the Swiss Guarantor at the time the Swiss Guarantor is required to perform under the Indenture, its Guarantee and the Security Documents; provided that this is a requirement under applicable Swiss law at that time and provided further that such limitation shall not discharge the Swiss Guarantor from its obligations in excess thereof, but merely postpone the performance date thereof until such times as performance is again permitted notwithstanding such limitation.
(2)           In respect of Restricted Obligations, each Swiss Guarantor shall:
(A)    if and to the extent required by applicable law in force at the relevant time mitigate to the extent possible any tax imposed based on the Swiss Federal Act on withholding tax of 13 October 1965 (the “Swiss Anticipatory Tax”) to be levied on the Restricted Obligations (and cause its parent and other relevant Affiliates to fully cooperate in any mitigating efforts) and promptly notify the Primary Collateral Agent thereof or, if such a notification procedure is not applicable:

(3)           To the extent a Swiss Guarantor is required to deduct Swiss Anticipatory Tax pursuant to Section 11.02(f)(2) hereof, and if the maximum amount of freely disposable shareholder equity pursuant to Section 11.02(f)(1) hereof is not utilized, additional security interests granted by such Swiss Guarantor under this Indenture shall be enforced until the enforcement proceeds equal an amount that (after making any deduction of Swiss Anticipatory Tax) would have resulted if no deduction of Swiss Anticipatory Tax had been required; provided that such enforcement amount (including the increased
110
amount) shall in any event be limited to the maximum amount of freely distributable equity capital pursuant to Section 11.02(f)(1) hereof.

111
For this purpose, “Net Assets” shall mean all the assets (actifs) of the Luxembourg Guarantor minus its liabilities (provisions et dettes) as valued in accordance with Luxembourg generally accepted accounting principles (Lux GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable, and the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg Act of 19 December 2002 on the Register of Commerce and Companies, on accounting and on annual accounts of the companies, as amended.
Where, for the purpose of the above determination, no duly established annual accounts are available for the relevant reference period (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes a situation where, in respect of the determination to be made under (a) above, no final annual accounts have been established in due time in respect of the then most recently ended financial year) the Luxembourg Guarantor shall, within reasonable time, establish unaudited interim accounts (as of the date of the end of the then most recent financial quarter) or annual accounts (as applicable) duly established in accordance with Luxembourg generally accepted accounting principles, pursuant to which the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor’s Net Assets will be determined.
If the Luxembourg Guarantor fails to provide such financial information within 45 Business Days as from the request of the Agent, the Agent, acting reasonably, may appoint an independent auditor (réviseur d’entreprises agréé) which shall undertake the determination of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s Net Assets.
In order to prepare such determination, the independent auditor (réviseur d’entreprises agréé) shall follow the Luxembourg accounting principles applicable to the Luxembourg Guarantor and shall in particular take into consideration such available elements and facts at such time including, without limitation, the latest annual accounts of such Luxembourg Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, any recent valuation of the assets of such Luxembourg Guarantor and its Subsidiaries (if available), the market value of the assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as if sold between a willing buyer and a willing seller as a going concern using a standard market multi criteria approach combining market multiples, book value, discounted cash flow or comparable public transaction of which price is known (taking into account circumstances at the time of the valuation and making all necessary adjustments to the assumption being used) and acting in a reasonable manner.

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes of the Issuer will be published in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in Europe.
Such  notices  may  also  be  published  on  the  website  of  the  Irish  Stock  Exchange (www.ise.ie) or the website of the Issuer.
117
Any such notice or demand will be deemed to have been sufficiently given or served when so sent or deposited and, if to the Holders, when delivered in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of the relevant clearing system, as the case may be.
Section 13.02       Currency Indemnity.
(a)           The Swiss franc is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees and this Indenture.
Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency other than Swiss francs (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee and/or a Holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such parties from the Issuer or the Guarantors will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the Swiss franc amount that the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase Swiss francs on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so).
For the purposes of this paragraph, it will be sufficient for the Trustee and/or Holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of Swiss francs been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of Swiss francs on that date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible).
These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:
(1)           constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations;
(2)           give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;
(3)           apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note; and
(4)           will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.
118
Section 13.03       Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent.

(2)           an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (which must include the statements set forth in Section 13.04 hereof) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent and covenants have been satisfied.
Section 13.04       Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion.
Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture will include:
(1)           a statement that the Person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition;
(2)           a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based;
(3)           a statement that, in the opinion of such Person, he or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been satisfied; and
(4)           a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such Person, such condition or covenant has been satisfied.
Section 13.05       Rules by Trustee and Agents.
The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or at a meeting of Holders.
The Registrar or Paying Agent may make reasonable rules and set reasonable requirements for its functions.

(b)           any change in the official application, administration or interpretation of the laws, regulations or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) that becomes effective on or after the date of the Indenture (or, in the case of a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Indenture, on or after such date; provided that there has been no formal proposal for such change or amendment the enactment of which was imminent when the jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction),

FORM OF SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE
I hereby certify as follows solely in my capacity as [Director]/[Financial Officer] of the Issuer, and not individually:
1.
I am, and at all pertinent times mentioned herein, have been the duly qualified and acting [Director]/[Chief Financial Officer] of the Issuer.
In such capacity I have responsibility for the overall management of the financial affairs of the Issuer and the preparation of the financial statements of the Issuer.
I am familiar with the properties, business, assets and liabilities of the Issuer and its business plans for the foreseeable future.
I am authorized to execute this Certificate on behalf of the Issuer.
2.
In connection with the preparation of this Certificate, I have made such investigations and inquiries as I deem necessary and reasonably prudent therefor and to accurately make the certifications expressed herein.
The assumptions that underlie and form the basis for the representations made in this Certificate were reasonable when made and continue to be reasonable as of the date hereof.
Based on the foregoing, on behalf of the Issuer, I have reached the following conclusions:
A.
As of the date hereof, after the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens:
(i)                                     the fair value of the assets of the Issuer are in excess of the total amount of its liabilities (including, without limitation, contingent and prospective liabilities, computed as the amount that, in light of all the facts and circumstances now existing, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability);
(ii)                                  the present fair saleable value of the assets of the Issuer is greater than its probable total liability on its existing debts as such debts become absolute and matured;
(iii)                               the Issuer is able to pay its debts as they fall due and has not (a) been deemed or declared to be unable to pay its debts under applicable law, (b) suspended or threatened to suspend making payments on any of its debts by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties or (c) commenced negotiations with one or more of its creditors with a view to rescheduling any of its indebtedness due to actual or anticipated financial difficulties; and
(iv)                              the Issuer has capital that is not unreasonably small for its business and is sufficient to carry on its business as conducted and as proposed to be conducted.
B.
The Issuer is not, on the date hereof, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, voluntary or judicial liquidation, composition with creditors, compromise agreement or assignment with any creditor of the Issuer, reprieve from payment, controlled management, claims of fraudulent
F-1
conveyance that would reasonably be expected to result in a judgment that the Issuer would be unable to satisfy, general settlement with creditors, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
C.            The Issuer is not, on the date hereof and will, as a result of its Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, not be in a state of cessation of payments.
D.            No application has been made by the Issuer or, as far as the Issuer is aware, by any other person for the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager, conciliador, sindico or similar officer pursuant to any insolvency or similar proceedings.
E.            No application has been made by the Issuer for a voluntary winding-up or liquidation nor has any judicial winding-up or liquidation been commenced or initiated against the Issuer nor has any suspension of payments, moratorium of any indebtedness, winding-up, dissolution, administration or reorganization (by way of voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or otherwise) of the Issuer been initiated against the Issuer.
F.             No corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedure or step has been taken in relation to any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction that affects any asset or assets of the Issuer having an aggregate value of US$500,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies).
“Fair saleable value” means the amount that could be obtained for assets within a reasonable time, either through collection or through sale under ordinary selling conditions by a capable and diligent seller to an interested buyer who is willing (but under no compulsion) to purchase.
None of the Issuer, or any of its Subsidiaries intends, in Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens or in Incurring (by way of assumption or otherwise) any related obligations or liabilities (contingent or otherwise), to disturb, delay, hinder or defraud either present or future creditors or other Persons to which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is or are intended to become, on or after the date hereon, indebted.
