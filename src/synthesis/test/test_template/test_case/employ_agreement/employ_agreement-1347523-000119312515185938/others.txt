WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into an employment agreement.
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
The Executive, in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, shall faithfully perform for the Company the duties of said office and shall perform such other duties of an executive, managerial or administrative nature consistent with the office of Chief Financial Officer as shall be specified and designated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
The Executive shall devote substantially all of the Executive’s business time and effort to the performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder.
Provided that the following activities do not interfere with the Executive’s duties to the Company and provided that the following activities do not violate the Executive’s covenant against competition as described at Section 6.2 hereof, during the Term the Executive may perform personal, charitable and other business activities, including, without limitation, serving as a member of one or more boards of directors of charitable or other professional organizations and engaging in any activities permitted by Section 6.2(d)(i), may engage in personal investment activities consistent with Company policies on personal securities trading by Company personnel, may serve on the boards of directors/advisors or as a consultant to other business organizations that are not engaged in any aspect of the multi-family residential industry, and may engage in such other board or professional assignments which are disclosed to and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), provided, however, that service in such capacities for other business organizations shall require the consent of the Board, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
During the Term, the Executive will be entitled to all employee benefits and perquisites made available to senior executives of the Company, including, without limitation, group medical, dental, vision, life insurance, long-term disability insurance, retirement, pension, 401(k) savings plans and/or prescription drug plan coverage, subject to the condition that the Executive is eligible for participation in any such plans.
The Executive shall be entitled to twenty-five (25) days of paid time off per calendar year, plus Company-scheduled holidays.
Fifty percent (50%) of any unused paid time-off will be forfeited at the end of the calendar year.3.5 Disability Benefits and Life Insurance.
Executive shall receive the disability benefits and group life insurance benefits applicable to senior executives at the Company.
Upon the occurrence of a “Change in Control” (as such term is defined in the 2012 LTIP Plan, as amended and in effect as of the Effective Date hereof), all Equity Compensation awarded to the Executive under this Agreement, to the extent not vested as of the date of the Change in Control or to the extent that any such award is subject to forfeiture restrictions as of the date of the Change in Control, shall, be deemed vested and all forfeiture restrictions shall lapse (treating any applicable performance criteria as fully satisfied).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary for the Executive to avoid taxes and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”), a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur unless it constitutes a “change in control event” within the meaning of Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Tax Code.4.
(ii) all of the outstanding Equity Compensation awards held by the Executive for which (a) vesting is based on the passage of time shall become fully vested and if applicable, exercisable and (b) vesting is based on establishment of performance goals and the performance period is incomplete shall be deemed earned based on the actual levels of achievement of pro-rated performance criteria as of the date of the termination of the Executive’s employment, as determined by the Committee; provided, that such Equity Compensation awards shall be deemed earned based on the target level of achievement with respect to the performance criteria relating to strategic objectives.
Such Equity Compensation awards shall be pro-rated based 4
The number of shares of the Company’s common stock that will be issued to the Executive in respect of such earned Equity Compensation awards which are otherwise settled in Company common stock shall be calculated based on the closing price per share on the trading date coinciding with (or if such date is not a trading day, next following) the date of the termination of the Executive’s employment, or, if the common stock is not trading, based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Board (or Compensation Committee) without reduction for minority discounts and/or lack of liquidity.
With respect to all Equity Compensation awards held by the Executive for which the performance period is complete but for which the additional vesting period is incomplete, any restrictions on the earned portion of such awards shall lapse and such earned awards, unless earlier terminated or forfeited and to the extent not otherwise vested, shall automatically become fully vested as of the date of the termination of the Executive’s employment.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Equity Compensation awards held by the Executive that are vested as of the date of the Executive’s termination of employment without Good Reason shall not be forfeited.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Tax Code, any payments of “deferred compensation” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(1), after giving effect to the exemptions in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(3) through (b)(12)), shall not commence until the first day of the seventh month beginning after the date of the Executive’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) to avoid the imposition of the additional 20% tax under Section 409A of the Tax Code (and in the case of installment payments, the first payment shall include all installment payments required by this subsection that otherwise would have been made during such period); and(ii) for a period of eighteen (18) months after termination of employment, the Company shall reimburse Executive’s COBRA premium under the Company’s major medical group health and dental plan (including the costs of Executive’s premium required to maintain coverage for his dependents), and the Company will provide such additional continuing health, dental, disability and life insurance benefits applicable to senior executives of the Company generally as the Executive and his dependents would have received under this Agreement (and for such additional benefits, at such costs to the Company, provided that the value of premiums on all primary or supplemental disability policies shall be taxed as income to the Executive) as would have applied in the absence of such termination or expiration (but not taking into account any post-termination increases in Annual Salary that may otherwise have occurred without regard to such termination and that may have favorably affected such benefits), it being expressly understood and agreed that nothing in this clause (b)(ii) shall restrict the ability of the Company to generally amend or terminate such plans and programs from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Company shall in no event be required to provide such reimbursements or coverage after such time as the Executive becomes entitled to receive health benefits from another employer or recipient of the Executive’s services (and provided, further, that such entitlement shall be determined without regard to any individual waivers or other arrangements);(iii) all of the Equity Compensation awarded to the Executive, to the extent not vested or to the extent subject to forfeiture restrictions as of the date of the termination of the Executive’s employment, shall immediately be deemed vested and any forfeiture restrictions shall immediately lapse (treating the performance criteria for the year of termination as fully satisfied), and any outstanding options to acquire shares of Company stock shall immediately be vested and shall be, as determined in the discretion of the Board, either (A) exercisable by the Executive or, in the case of the Executive’s death, by the beneficiaries of the Executive’s estate, for one (1) year following the termination (or, if shorter, the balance of the regular term of the options), or (B) cashed out and cancelled, as if in accordance with a Change in Control event, pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 8.03 of the 2012 LTIP Plan as in effect on the Effective Date hereof.Unless delayed pursuant to Section 7.18 of this Agreement, payments due under the Severance Package shall be paid to the Executive (or installment payments shall commence) on the fiftieth (50th) day following the date of the termination event.
Covenants of the Executive.6.1 General Covenants of the Executive.
The Executive acknowledges that (a) the principal business of the Company is the acquisition, development and ownership of multi-family residential properties (such business, and any and all other businesses that after the date hereof, and from time to time during the Term, become material with respect to the Company’s then-overall business, herein being collectively referred to as the “Business”) (for purposes of this Agreement, “Multi-family REIT” shall mean a company that invests in primarily multi-family residential properties and that is qualified as a real estate investment trust for purposes of federal income taxation); (b) the Company knows of a limited number of persons who have developed the Business; (c) the Business is, in part, national in scope; (d) the Executive’s work for the Company and its subsidiaries has given and will continue to give the Executive access to the confidential affairs and proprietary information of the Company and to “trade secrets,” (as defined under the laws of the State of Maryland) of the Company and its subsidiaries; (e) the covenants and agreements of the Executive contained in this Section 6 are essential to the business and goodwill of the Company; and (f) the Company would not have entered into this Agreement but for the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 6.6.2 Covenant Against Competition.

(ii) Except in connection with the business and affairs of the Company and its affiliates: the Executive shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and shall not use for his benefit or the benefit of others, all confidential matters relating to the Business and the business of any of its affiliates and to the Company and any of its affiliates, learned by the Executive heretofore or hereafter directly or indirectly from the Company or any of its subsidiaries (or any predecessor of either) (the “Confidential Company Information”), including, without limitation, information with respect to the Business and any aspect thereof, profit or loss figures, and the Company’s or its affiliates’ (or any of their predecessors) properties, and shall not disclose such Confidential Company Information to anyone outside of the Company except with the Company’s express written consent and except for Confidential Company Information which (i) at the time of receipt or thereafter becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Executive; (ii) is clearly obtainable in the public domain; (iii) was not acquired by the Executive in connection with the Executive’s employment or affiliation with the Company; (iv) was not acquired by the Executive from the Company or its representatives or from a third-party who has an agreement with the Company not to disclose such information; (v) was legally in the possession of or developed by the Executive prior to the Effective Date; or (vi) is required to be disclosed by rule of law or by order of a court or governmental body or agency.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing shall prevent the Executive from soliciting loans, investment capital, or the provision of management services from third parties engaged in the Business if the activities of the Executive facilitated thereby do not otherwise adversely interfere with the operations of the Business.
Advertising to fill employment openings by television, newspaper, Internet or similar general advertising will not be deemed to violate this Section.
Notwithstanding the above, the Executive’s contacts and contact data base shall not be the Company’s property.
Notwithstanding the above, software, methods and material developed by the Executive prior to the Term of the Agreement shall not be the Company’s property.
6.3 Rights and Remedies upon Breach.
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that any breach by him of any of the provisions of Sections 6.1 or 6.2 (the “Restrictive Covenants”) would result in irreparable injury and damage for which money damages would not provide an adequate remedy.
Therefore, if the Executive breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, the Company and its affiliates shall have the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced (without posting bond and without the need to prove damages) by any court having equity jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the right to an entry against the Executive of restraining orders and injunctions (preliminary, mandatory, temporary and permanent) against violations, threatened or actual, and whether or not then continuing, of such covenants.
This right and remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Company and its affiliates under law or in equity (including, without limitation, the recovery of damages).
The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of the Restrictive Covenants.
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Executive has had an opportunity to seek advice of counsel in connection with this Agreement and that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects.
If it is determined that any of the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of this Agreement shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid portions.7.2 Duration and Scope of Covenants.
If any court or other decision maker of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the Executive’s covenants contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the duration or geographical scope of such provision, then, after such determination has become final and unappealable, the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, shall be reduced so that such provision becomes enforceable and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.7.3 Arbitration.
Except with respect to any claims or disputes arising from or relating to the Restrictive Covenants or arising after a Change in Control, any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration, to be held in Baltimore, Maryland in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules, as amended from time to time, of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).
The Company and the Executive will each select an arbitrator, and a third arbitrator will be selected jointly by the arbitrators selected by the Company and the Executive within 15 days after demand for arbitration is made by a Party.
If the arbitrators selected by the Company and the Executive are unable to agree on a third arbitrator within that period, then either the Company or the Executive may request that the AAA select the third arbitrator.
The arbitrators will possess substantive legal experience in the principle issues in dispute and will be independent of the Company and the Executive.
Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by the parties or as ordered by the arbitrators upon substantial justification shown, the hearing for the dispute will be held within 60 days of submission of the dispute to arbitration.
The arbitrators will render their final award within 30 days following conclusion of the hearing and any required post-hearing briefing or other proceedings ordered by the arbitrators.
The arbitrators will state the factual and legal basis for the award.
The decision of the arbitrators will be final and binding and not subject to judicial review and final judgment may be entered upon such an award in any court of competent jurisdiction, but entry of such judgment will not be required to make such award effective.7.4 Notices.
This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, with the Company or its subsidiaries (or any predecessor of either).7.6 Waivers and Amendments.
This Agreement may be amended, superseded, canceled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument signed by the parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance.
No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such right, power or privilege nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.7.7 GOVERNING LAW.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED EXCLUSIVELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the parties; provided, however, that except as herein expressly provided, this Agreement shall not be assignable either by the Company (except to an affiliate of the Company, in which event the Company shall remain liable if the affiliate fails to meet any of the Company’s obligations hereunder, including without limitation to provide the employment opportunities offered hereby and to make payments or provide benefits or otherwise) or by the Executive.
In the event that the Executive consents to the assignment of this Agreement to a successor in interest of the Company upon a Change in Control, such consent shall not be deemed to waive or diminish the Executive’s rights under Section 3.8(a).7.9 Withholding.
The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of withholding required by law.
In the event that the Company determines that any federal, state, local or foreign tax or withholding payment is required relating to the vesting in or delivery of any Equity Compensation, the Company shall have the right to require such payments from the Executive or withhold such amounts from other payments due to the Executive from the Company or any affiliate, or to withhold such Equity Compensation that would otherwise have been issued to the Executive.
The Executive shall have the right to elect, in his discretion, the manner in which such payments shall be made or withheld.
No other taxes, fees, impositions, duties or other charges or offsets of any kind shall be deducted or withheld from amounts payable hereunder, unless otherwise required by law.7.10 No Duty to Mitigate.

The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.7.16 Parachute Provisions.
(a) The provisions of this Section 7.16(a) shall apply prior to the effective time of an initial public offering of the Company.
If any amount payable to or other benefit receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement is deemed to constitute a Parachute Payment (as defined below), alone or when added to any other amount payable or paid to or other benefit receivable or received by the Executive which is deemed to constitute a Parachute Payment (whether or not under an existing plan, arrangement or other agreement), and would result in the imposition on the Executive of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Tax Code (the “Excise Tax”), then, in addition to any other benefits to which the Executive is entitled under this Agreement, the Executive shall be paid by the Company an amount in cash equal to the sum of the excise taxes payable by the Executive by reason of receiving Parachute Payments plus the amount necessary to put the Executive in the same after-tax position (taking into account any and all applicable federal, state and local excise, income or other taxes at the highest applicable rates on such Parachute Payments and on any payments under this Section 7.16(a)) as if no excise taxes had been imposed with respect to Parachute Payments.
“Parachute Payment” shall mean any payment deemed to constitute a “parachute payment” as defined in Section 280G of the Tax Code.
(b) The provisions of this Section 7.16(b) shall apply from and after the effective time of an initial public offering of the Company.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (a “Payment”) would be subject to the Excise Tax, then, prior to the making of any Payment to Executive, a calculation shall be made comparing (i) the net benefit to the Executive of the Payment after payment of the Excise Tax, to (ii) the net benefit to the Executive if the Payment had been limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax.
For purposes of this Section 7.16(b), present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Tax Code.
For purposes of this Section 7.16(b), the “Parachute Value” of a Payment means the present value as of the date of the change of control of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Tax Code, as determined by the Determination Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.
The determination of whether an Excise Tax would be imposed, the amount of such Excise Tax, and the calculation of the amounts referred to in this Section 7.16(b) above shall be made by an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm or compensation consulting firm mutually acceptable to the Company and the Executive (the “Determination Firm”) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations.
Any determination by the Determination Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.
As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Tax Code at the time of the initial determination by the Determination Firm hereunder, it is possible that Payments which the Executive was entitled to, but did not receive pursuant to this Section 7.16(b), could have been made without the imposition of the Excise Tax (“Underpayment”).
In such event, the Determination Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive but no later than March 15 of the year after the year in which the Underpayment is determined to exist, which is when the legally binding right to such Underpayment arises.
In the event that Tax Code Sections 280G and 4999 or any successor provisions are repealed without succession, this Section 7.16 shall be of no further force or effect.7.17 Indemnification; Directors and Officer’s Insurance.
The Executive shall be entitled to indemnification in all instances in which the Executive is acting within the scope of his authority to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and not prohibited by the Company’s charter and bylaws, from and against any damages or liabilities, including reasonable attorney’s fees; provided, however, that the Executive shall not be entitled to indemnification for damages or liabilities which result from or arise out of the Executive’s willful misconduct or gross negligence.
This Agreement and the amounts payable and other benefits hereunder are intended to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Section 409A of the Tax Code.
This Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with Section 409A.
If any provision of this Agreement is found not to comply with, or otherwise not to be exempt from, the provisions of Section 409A, it shall be modified and given effect, in the sole discretion of the Board or Compensation Committee thereof and without requiring the Executive’s consent, in such manner as the Board or Compensation Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with, or to effectuate an exemption from, Section 409A.
The preceding provisions shall not be construed as a guarantee by the Company of any particular tax effect to the Executive of the payments and other benefits under this Agreement.
Section 1.409A-1(h)) while the Executive is a “specified employee” (as defined under Treas.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have signed their names to this Employment Agreement as of the day and year set forth below.

50% of earned Equity Compensation awards will vest upon the conclusion of the performance period and 50% of earned Equity Compensation awards will vest on the first anniversary of the conclusion of the performance period.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Equity Compensation awards provided for in Sections 2(b) and 3 of this Attachment A shall not be subject to the terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in this Section 2(a) of Attachment A.
A “Successful Capital Transaction” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the consummation of a sale, merger or Change in Control (as such term is A-1

I represent and warrant that I have not previously filed or joined in any such claims, demands or entitlements against the Company or the other persons released herein and that I will indemnify and hold them harmless from all liabilities, claims, demands, costs, expenses and/or attorneys’ fees incurred as a result of any such claims, demands or lawsuits.Except as otherwise expressly provided above, this General Release specifically includes, but is not limited to, all claims of breach of contract, employment discrimination (including any claims coming within the scope of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and any comparable Maryland law, all as amended, or any other applicable federal, state, or local law), claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended (or any other applicable federal, state or local statute relating to payment of wages), claims concerning recruitment, hiring, termination, salary rate, severance pay, stock options, wages or benefits due, sick leave, holiday pay, vacation pay, life insurance, group medical insurance, any other fringe benefits, worker’s compensation, termination, employment status, libel, slander, defamation, intentional or negligent misrepresentation and/or infliction of emotional distress, together with any and all tort, contract, or other claims which might have been asserted by me or on my behalf in any suit, charge of discrimination, or claim against the Company or the persons released herein.
