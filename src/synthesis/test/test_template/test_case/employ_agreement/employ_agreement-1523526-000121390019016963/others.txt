If the consultant provides a range, adjusted to reflect performance of the Company comparable to the Company’s peer group, and the Company proposes a compensation package that is at least the median level within that range, the comparability requirement shall be deemed satisfied.

Disclosure.
Employee further agrees that all information and records pertaining to any idea, process, trademark, service mark, invention, technology, computer program, original work or authorship, design formula, discovery, patent or copyright that Employee does not believe to be Work Product, but is conceived, developed or reduced to practice by Employee (alone or with others) during Employee’s employment, or during the one (1) year period following termination of Employee’s employment, shall be promptly disclosed to the Company (such disclosure to be received in confidence).

In the event any Work Product will be deemed by the Company to be patentable or otherwise registrable, Employee agrees to assist the Company Group (at its expense) in obtaining letters patent or other applicable registrations, and Employee will execute all documents and do all other things (including testifying at the Company’s expense) necessary or proper to obtain letters patent or other applicable registrations and to vest the Company or a member of the Company Group with full title to them.
Should the Company or a member of the Company Group be unable to secure Employee’s signature on any document necessary to apply for, prosecute, obtain or enforce any patent, copyright or other right or protection relating to any Work Product, whether due to Employee’s mental or physical incapacity or any other cause, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and each of its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on Employee’s behalf, to execute and file any such document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance and enforcement of patents, copyrights or other rights of protections with the same force and effect as if executed and delivered by Employee.
If Employee resides in California, the foregoing assignment clause in this Section 9(c) will not apply to an invention that Employee developed entirely on Employee’s own time without using the Company Group’s equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information except for those inventions that either: (i) relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the Company’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company; or (ii) result from any work performed by Employee for the Company Group.
Code § 2870(a).
Employee hereby waives any and all moral rights that might otherwise accrue with respect to any Work Product.
Employee agrees that, during Employee’s employment with the Company or any member of Company Group, and following termination of Employee’s employment, except as required by law, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, at any time, disclose to any third person or use in any way any non-public information or Confidential Information (i) regarding the business of any member of the Company Group and (ii) concerning any Business Opportunities (as defined below).
11  a. Definitions.
For purposes of this Agreement – (i) “Confidential Information” shall mean all confidential information, proprietary information or trade secrets (whether oral or written, whether maintained in hard copy, electronically (including, without limitation, in email or text messages) or otherwise) and including: (i) Know-How (as defined below), Trade Secrets (as defined in Section 11), information related to Business Opportunities, prospects, pricing, trading, trading strategies and methodologies, portfolio management strategies, programs, methods of operation, prospective and existing contracts, business plans, procedures, and strategies, costs profits, databases, personnel, operational methods, financial models, potential transactions, pending negotiations, computer programs, algorithms, negotiations, lists of actual and/or prospective clients and/or investors, financial results, business developments, internal controls, security procedures and confidential programs or procedures; (ii) Company Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) that constitute proprietary Know-How and Customer Information (as defined below and if and to the extent that such proprietary Know-How and Customer Information has been maintained as Company’s confidential information as of the date of this Agreement) and Trade Secrets; and (iii) information received by the Company Group from third parties under confidential conditions.
(ii) “Business Opportunities” shall mean: (1) any business plan or prospective new business developed or provided by Employee to the Company Group; and (2) any business plan or prospective new business developed by the Company or, to Employee’s knowledge, any of members of the Company Group that Employee has access to or otherwise becomes aware of during Employee’s employment with the Company or Company Group.
(iii) “Company Intellectual Property Rights” shall mean all Work Product and any other intellectual property owned or licensed by any member of the Company Group, including: (1) all United States and foreign patents and patent applications that describe or claim inventions and improvements currently used, or currently conceived or currently developed for use, that when used herein includes any electronic medium or tangible embodiment of the Company Group, any United States or foreign counterparts, non-provisionals, divisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, and reissues thereof, heretofore or hereafter filed or having legal force in any country of the world, and the inventions and improvements disclosed therein (the “Patents”);
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information and Business Opportunities shall not include information: (i) that at the date hereof is in the public domain; (ii) that has come within the public domain through no fault or action of Employee that has the obligation of confidentiality (provided, however, that the fact that general information may be in or become part of the public domain, in and of itself, does not exclude any specific information from the obligations of this Agreement); (iii) that after the date hereof has been obtained lawfully from any third party that was entitled to disclose such information; and/or (iv) that an Employee is compelled to disclose by any judicial or administrative order after having given prompt notice of such order to the Company.
Specific aspects or details of the Confidential Information will not be deemed to be published, generally known in the trade or otherwise within the public domain, or to be in possession of Employee, merely because the aspects of the Confidential Information are embraced by general disclosures in the public domain or in Employee’s possession.
In addition, any combination of aspects of the Confidential Information will not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of Employee merely because individual elements thereof are in the public domain or in Employee’s possession unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in Employee’s possession.
The burden of proving these exceptions to the confidentiality and use provisions of this Agreement resides with Employee.
Employee agrees to: (i) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not give, sell or disclose Confidential Information to any other third party, unless such party is an auditor or contractor hired by any member of the Company Group and then only upon written approval of the Board; (iii) not share or otherwise use the Confidential Information in violation of or in any manner inconsistent with the Company’s information protection and transfer policies in place from time to time, applicable privacy laws, applicable state and federal law, any other applicable laws, and GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679) to the extent that it applies; and (iv) not share or otherwise use the Confidential Information in violation of or in any manner inconsistent with the Company’s policies or reasonable requests made by the Company from time to time.
For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Employee from responding to any lawful subpoena or legal process, or sharing any Confidential Information or other information with regulators or appropriate governmental agencies without notice to the Company, whether in response to subpoena or otherwise, under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation, and no prior authorization or notification is required prior to Employee making any such reports or disclosures, provided that no attorney client privilege shall be waived.
Employee acknowledges that Employee’s obligations under Section 10 are separate and distinct from Employee’s promise and obligation, affirmed by this Agreement, not to disclose or use the Company Group’s “Trade Secrets,” as defined by the applicable state statutory and common law and by federal law.
During and at all times after the Term, Trade Secrets of the Company Group shall be subject to the maximum protections available under applicable law and no less protection than that provided by this Agreement applicable to “Confidential Information,” as described in Section 10.
Employee further acknowledges and agrees that protection of the Company Group’s Trade Secrets is governed by Employee’s promises in this Agreement and by any applicable law.

A person or entity (including, without limitation, Employee) shall be deemed to be engaging in “Competition” with a member of the Company Group if such person or entity either engages primarily in the Restricted Business or engages in any other type of business that comprises a significant portion of any member of the Company Group’s revenues as of the date of Employee’s termination and for which Employee had responsibility or authority, or about which business Employee received Confidential Information during the course of Employee’s employment.

“Restricted Employee” shall mean any individual who was employed by any member of the Company Group during the course of Employee’s term of employment and with whom Employee had material contact during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date of Employee’s termination.

The Company agrees to instruct its Board, Chief Executive Officer, President and Senior Executive Vice Presidents, whether in private or in public, directly or indirectly, to not make, publish, encourage, ratify, or authorize, or aid, assist or direct any other person or entity in making or publishing, any statements that in any way defame or disparage Employee, and the Company will not be responsible for any damages suffered by Employee to the extent that the Board provides such instruction and does not in any way explicitly contradict such instruction.
Employee acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the provisions and covenants set forth in Sections 9 through 13 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that the Company Group may have available to it under any laws (including any law preventing the disclosure of Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information); (ii) any enforcement of the Sections 9 through 13 by the Company shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or remedies that the Company Group may possess at law or in equity absent this Agreement; (iii) on account of Employee’s service to the Company Group, Employee has been, and will in the future be, made aware of Trade Secrets and other valuable Confidential Information, including information relating to any member of the Company Group, and their respective customers, clients and employees, in each case that could be used to the great competitive disadvantage of, and cause great financial harm to, the Company Group if provided to any competitor; (iv) Sections 9, 10, 11 and 13 are necessary to prevent the use and disclosure of Trade Secrets and other Confidential Information, to protect the relationships between the Company Group members and their respective customers and employees, to protect the goodwill of the Company Group and to protect other legitimate business interests of the Company Group; and (v) all of the restrictive covenants are reasonable in all respects, including duration, territory and scope of activity restricted.

The time periods referenced in Section 13 shall be extended on a day-for-day basis for each day during which Employee is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated the provisions of Section 13 in any respect, so that Employee is restricted from engaging in the activities prohibited by Section 13 for the full Restricted Period.
