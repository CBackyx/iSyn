(b)    Until the occurrence of the Investor Board Seat Fall-Away, if the Company proposes to issue equity securities of any kind (the term “equity securities” shall include for these purposes Common Stock and any warrants, options or other rights to acquire, or any securities that are exercisable for, exchangeable for or convertible into, Common Stock or any other class of capital stock of the Company), other than in an Excluded Issuance, then the Company shall:(i)    give written notice to the Investor (no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the closing of such issuance (or, in the case of a registered public offering, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the commencement of such registered public offering) or, if the Company reasonably expects such issuance to be completed in less than five (5) Business Days, such shorter period, which shall be as long as commercially practicable setting forth in reasonable detail (A) the designation and all of the terms and provisions of the securities proposed to be issued (the “Proposed Securities”), including, to the extent applicable, the voting powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualification, limitations or restrictions thereof and interest rate and maturity; (B) the price and other terms of the proposed sale of such securities; and (C) the amount of such securities proposed to be issued; and(ii)    offer to issue and sell to the Investor Parties, on such terms as the Proposed Securities are issued and upon full payment by the Investor Parties, a portion of the Proposed Securities equal to a percentage determined by dividing (A) the number of shares of Common Stock the Investor Parties beneficially own (on an as-converted basis) by (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (on an as-converted basis); provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to offer to issue or sell to the Investor Parties (or to any of them) a number of the Proposed Securities that would require the Company to obtain stockholder approval in respect of the issuance of any Proposed Securities under the listing rules of the Nasdaq or any other securities exchange or any other applicable Law.
(c)    The Investor will have the option, on behalf of the applicable Investor Parties, exercisable by written notice to the Company, to accept the Company’s offer and commit 31
to purchase any or all of the equity securities offered to be sold by the Company to the Investor Parties, which notice must be given within five (5) days after receipt of such notice from the Company (or such shorter period if the notice by the Company was sent in accordance with the preceding paragraph less than five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date, and in no event less than one (1) Business Day) (the failure of the Investor to respond within such time period shall be deemed a waiver of the Investor Parties’ rights under this Section 5.14 with respect to the applicable issuance of equity securities).
The closing of the exercise of such subscription right shall take place simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the Proposed Securities giving rise to such subscription right; provided, however, that (x) if such closing is prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date on which the Investor has notified the Company that the Investor Parties have elected to exercise their subscription right, then each Investor Party shall purchase the new equity securities within ten (10) Business Days following delivery of notice of exercise by the Investor and (y) the closing of any purchase by any such Investor Party may be extended beyond the closing of the sale of the Proposed Securities giving rise to such preemptive right to the extent necessary to obtain required approvals from any Governmental Authority.
(g)    In the event that the Investor Parties are not entitled to acquire any Proposed Securities pursuant to this Section 5.14 because such issuance would require the Company to obtain stockholder approval in respect of the issuance of such Proposed Securities under the listing rules of the Nasdaq or any other securities exchange or applicable Law, the Company shall, upon the Investor’s reasonable request delivered to the Company in writing within seven (7) Business Days following its receipt of the written notice of such issuance to the Investor pursuant to Section 5.14(b), at the Investor’s election, (i) waive the restrictions set forth in Section 5.07 solely to the extent necessary to permit any Investor Party to acquire a number of Proposed Securities equivalent to the amount of Proposed Securities that such Investor Party would have been entitled to purchase had it been entitled to acquire such Proposed Securities pursuant to Sections 5.14(a)-(c) and (ii) consider and discuss in good faith modifications proposed by the Investor Parties to the terms and conditions of such portion of the Proposed Securities that would otherwise be issued to the Investor Parties such that the Company would not be required to obtain stockholder approval in respect of the issuance of such Proposed Securities as so modified.Section 5.15    Mandatory Conversion.
(c)    the Company shall have received a certificate, signed on behalf of the Investor by an executive officer thereof, certifying that the conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a) and Section 6.02(b) have been satisfied.Section 6.03    Conditions to the Obligations of the Investor.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
(e)    Record Date.
(g)    Conversion Following a Record Date.
If the Company elects to effect a Mandatory Conversion, the Company shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days following the filing of the Company’s relevant Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on From 10-Q or the completion of the Trading Period, as applicable, provide notice of a Mandatory Conversion to each Holder (such notice, a “Notice of Mandatory Conversion”).
For the avoidance of doubt, delivery of a Notice of Mandatory Conversion does not limit a Holder’s right to convert on a Conversion Date prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date.
The Mandatory Conversion Date selected by the Company shall be no less than five (5) Business Days and no more than twenty (20) Business Days after the date on which the Company provides the Notice of Mandatory Conversion to the Holders.
A Holder must do each of the following in order to receive shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 8:(i)    in the case of an Optional Conversion, complete and manually sign the conversion notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the “Conversion Notice”), and deliver such notice to the Company; provided, however, that a Conversion Notice may be conditional on the completion of a Change of Control or other corporate transaction as such Holder may specify; 15
(ii)    deliver to the Company the certificate or certificates (if any) representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted;(iii)    if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents; and(iv)    if required, pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to Section 18.The foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) shall be conditions to the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Holders in the event of a Mandatory Conversion pursuant to Section 7 (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the Mandatory Conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date).The “Conversion Date” means (A) with respect to an Optional Conversion pursuant to Section 6(a), the date on which such Holder complies with the procedures in this Section 8 (including the satisfaction of any conditions to conversion set forth in the Conversion Notice) and (B) with respect to Mandatory Conversion pursuant to Section 7, the Mandatory Conversion Date.
As promptly as practicable on or after the Conversion Date and compliance by the applicable Holder with the relevant procedures contained in Section 8 (and in any event no later than three (3) Trading Days thereafter), the Company shall issue the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion (and deliver payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares as set out in Section 8(e)).
Such delivery of shares of Common Stock, securities or other property shall be made, at the option of the Company, in certificated form or by book-entry.
Any such certificate or certificates shall be delivered by the Company to the appropriate Holder on a book-entry basis or by mailing certificates evidencing the shares to the Holders at their respective addresses as set forth in the Conversion Notice (in the case of an Optional Conversion) or in the records of the Company (in the case of a Mandatory Conversion).
In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock (and payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be delivered upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock should be registered or paid, or the manner in which such shares and cash should be delivered, the Company shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Company.
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be delivered to the Holders upon conversion.
(a) Repurchase at the Option of the Holder.
On or before the twentieth (20th) Business Day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating a Change of Control (or, if later, promptly after the Company discovers that a Change of Control may occur), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Company, which notice shall set forth a description of the anticipated Change of Control and contain the date on which the Change of Control is anticipated to be effected (or, if applicable, the date on which a Schedule TO or other schedule, form or report disclosing a Change of Control was filed).
Within ten (10) days following the effective date of the Change of Control (the “Change of Control Effective Date”) (or, if later, promptly after the Company discovers that the Change of Control has occurred), the Company shall deliver to each Holder a written notice setting forth:(i)    the date, which shall be no earlier than the twentieth (20th) Business Day after the Change of Control Effective Date (or, if later, the date of delivery of such notice), by which the Change of Control Put must be exercised; 18
(ii)    the amount of cash or other consideration payable per share of Series A Preferred Stock, if such Holder elects to exercise a Change of Control Put;(iii)    a description of the payments and other actions required to be made or taken in order to effect the Satisfaction of Indebtedness Obligations;(iv)    the purchase date for such shares (which shall be no later than sixty (60) days from the date such notice is delivered); and(v)    the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its Change of Control Put in connection with such Change of Control.
To exercise a Change of Control Put, a Holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date specified in the written notice referred to in Section 9(c)(i) by which such option must be exercised, notify the Company in writing of the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock as to which such Change of Control Put is being exercised.
Upon a Change of Control Put, after Satisfaction of Indebtedness Obligations and subject to Section 9(h), the Company (or its successor) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder by mail or wire transfer the Change of Control Purchase Price of such Holder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
(iii)    The Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock (other than for cash in lieu of fractional shares), shares of any class of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, assets, other property or securities, but excluding (A) dividends or distributions referred to in Section 10(a)(i) or Section 10(a)(ii) hereof; (B) Distribution Transactions as to which Section 10(a)(iv) shall apply; (C) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash; and (D) rights, options or warrants distributed in connection with a stockholder rights plan as to which Section 10(a)(v) shall apply (any of such shares of its Capital Stock, indebtedness, assets or property that are not so excluded are hereinafter called the “Distributed Property”), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x [SP0 / (SP0 - FMV)]where,CR0    =    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;CR1    =    the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;SP0    =    the Current Market Price as of the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; andFMV    =    the Fair Market Value of the portion of Distributed Property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that, if FMV is equal or greater than SP0, then in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Company shall distribute to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock on the date the applicable Distributed Property is distributed to holders of Common Stock, but 23
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under this Section 10, the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) or the date the Company makes an adjustment pursuant to Section 10(f):(i)    compute the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate in accordance with this Section 10; and(ii)    (A) in the event that the Company shall give notice or make a public announcement to the holders of Common Stock of any action of the type described in Section 10 (but only if the action of the type described in Section 10 would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock), the Company shall, at the time of such notice or announcement, and in the case of any action that would require the fixing of a record date, at least ten (10) days prior to such record date, give notice to each Holder by mail, first-class postage prepaid, at the address appearing in the Register, which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action, the approximate date on which such action is to take place and the facts with respect to such action as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the Conversion Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property, which shall be deliverable upon conversion or redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock or (B) in the event that the Company does not give notice or make a public announcement as set forth in subclause (A) of this clause (ii), the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to one or more provisions of Section 10 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event, in the same manner and with the same detail as the notice set forth in subclause (A) of this clause (ii); and(iii)    whenever the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to one or more provisions of Section 10, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the determination of the revised Conversion Price, (A) file at the principal office of the Company, a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment, the Conversion Price that shall be in effect after such adjustment and the method by which the adjustment to the Conversion Price was determined and (B) cause a copy of such statement to be sent in the manner set forth in subclause (A) of clause (ii) to each Holder.SECTION 11.
The Company (or any successor) shall, no less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated effective date of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property.
Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 11.

All notices referred to herein shall be in writing and, unless otherwise specified herein, all notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of receipt thereof or three (3) Business Days after the mailing thereof if sent by registered or certified mail (unless first-class mail shall be specifically permitted for such notice under the 31

Upon receipt of such Demand Notice, the Company will notify all Holders (other than the Demanding Holders) in writing and such Holders shall have the right to request that the Company include all or a portion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in such Demand Registration by written notice delivered to the Company within five (5) calendar days after such notice is given by the Company.
(b)     Following receipt of a Demand Notice, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file as soon as reasonably practicable an Initial Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders so requesting in accordance with Section 1.1(a) (except if the Company is not then eligible to register for resale the Registrable Securities on a Registration Statement on Form S-3, then such registration shall be on another appropriate form and shall provide for the registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders in accordance with any reasonable method of distribution elected by the Holders of a Majority of the Registrable Securities covered thereby), and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Initial Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the filing thereof (it being agreed that the Initial Shelf Registration Statement shall be an automatic shelf Registration Statement that shall become effective upon filing with the SEC pursuant to Rule 462(e) if Rule 462(e) is available to the Company).
If a Person entitled to the benefits of this Agreement becomes a Holder of Registrable Securities after a Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, the Company shall, as promptly as is reasonably practicable following delivery of written notice to the Company of such Person becoming a Holder and requesting for its name to be included as a selling securityholder in the prospectus related to the Shelf Registration Statement (a “Subsequent Holder Notice”):(a)    if required and permitted by applicable law, file with the SEC a supplement to the related prospectus or a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement so that such Holder is named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus in such a manner as to permit such Holder to deliver a prospectus to purchasers of the Registrable Securities in accordance with applicable law; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to file more than one post-effective amendment or a supplement to the related prospectus for such purpose in any 30-day period;(b)    if, pursuant to Section 1.5(a), the Company shall have filed a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement that is not automatically effective, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable; and(c)    notify such Holder as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the effectiveness under the Securities Act of any post-effective amendment filed pursuant to Section 1.5(a).
(a)    Subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer in the Investment Agreement or otherwise, one or more Holders (each, a “Requesting Holder”) that have been specified in any Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC in accordance with Section 1.1 or Section 1.3, may, after such Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, deliver a written notice to the Company (the “Underwritten Offering Notice”) stating that the sale of some or all of the Registrable Securities subject to the Shelf Registration Statement, is intended to be conducted through an underwritten offering (an “Underwritten Offering”); provided, however, that the Holders of Registrable Securities may not, without the Company’s prior written consent, (i) launch an Underwritten Offering the anticipated gross proceeds of which shall be less than $50,000,000 (without regard to any underwriting discount or commission), unless the Holders are proposing to sell all of their remaining Registrable Securities and the anticipated gross proceeds from such sale will be more than $25,000,000 (without regard to any underwriting discount or commission), (ii) launch more than three Underwritten Offerings at the request of the Holders within any three-hundred sixty-five (365) day-period, (iii) launch an Underwritten Offering at the request of the Holders within 90 days following a prior offering in which Holders sold Registrable Securities or had the opportunity to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 1.6 or Section 1.8, or (iv) launch an Underwritten Offering within the period commencing nine (9) days prior to and ending two (2) trading days following the Company’s earnings release date for any fiscal quarter or year.
As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt by the Company of any Underwritten Offering Notice, the Company shall deliver the Piggyback Notice specified in Section 1.8(a) to all Holders (other than the Requesting Holders).
Subject to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, including the limitations in Section 1.6 regarding Underwritten Offerings, at any time that any Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if a Holder delivers a notice to the Company (a “Take- Down Notice”) stating that it intends to effect a sale or distribution of all or part of its Registrable Securities included by it on any Shelf Registration Statement (a “Shelf Offering”) and stating the number of the Registrable Securities to be included in such Shelf Offering, then the Company shall amend, subject to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be sold and distributed pursuant to the Shelf Offering.Section 1.8    Piggyback Rights.
