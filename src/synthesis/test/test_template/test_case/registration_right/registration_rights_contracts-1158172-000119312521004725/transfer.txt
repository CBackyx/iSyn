(a) If the Company proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Common Stock, whether or not for sale for its own account (other than a registration statement (i) on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any successor forms thereto or (ii) filed to effectuate an exchange offer or any employee benefit or dividend reinvestment plan), then the Company shall give prompt written notice of such filing, which notice shall be given, to the extent reasonably practicable, no later than seven Business Days prior to the filing date (the “Piggyback Notice”) to the Holders.
