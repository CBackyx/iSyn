Subject to applicable Law, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement.

(e) Each Company Related Party or Purchaser Related Party seeking indemnification hereunder (each, an “Indemnified Party”) shall use reasonable best efforts to pursue any and all rights it or any of its controlled Affiliates has to any applicable insurance proceeds, indemnity or contribution from a third party in respect of any Losses payable by the indemnitor hereunder (the “Indemnifying Party”) pursuant to this Article VIII, and any payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII in respect of such Losses shall be reduced by the amount of such insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its controlled Affiliates in respect of such Losses, less any related costs and expenses actually incurred by the Indemnified Party and its controlled Affiliates in pursuing such insurance claim or indemnity, contribution or other similar payment and the amount of any retrospective or other current increase in premium actually borne by the Indemnified Party or any of its controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, that is directly attributable to the payment of such insurance proceeds, and, if the Indemnified Party has previously received an indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Party for a Loss, promptly after the realization of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment with respect to such Loss, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for such payment (less any costs and expenses described in the preceding sentence).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue indemnification from the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement prior to, after or concurrently with the pursuit of any such rights to insurance proceeds, indemnity or contribution from a third party.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) no Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates will be entitled to recover more than one time for any particular Losses under this Agreement and (ii) to the extent an Indemnifying Party has paid any Losses under this Agreement to any Indemnified Party, no other Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of the claims for which such Losses were paid.
(g) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII for, and Losses shall not include, any Losses to the extent resulting from the actions or omissions of such Indemnified Party.
Each Indemnified Party shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate or minimize all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder and, if an Indemnified Party fails to use reasonable best efforts to so mitigate any indemnifiable Losses under this sentence, the Indemnifying Party that would otherwise have an indemnity obligation hereunder with respect to such Losses shall have no liability for any portion of such Losses that reasonably would have been avoided or mitigated had the Indemnified Party made such efforts.

8.5 Indemnification Procedure.
Promptly after an Indemnified Party has received notice of any indemnifiable claim hereunder, or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by a third person, which the Indemnified Party believes in good faith is an indemnifiable claim under this Agreement (each a “Third-Party Claim”), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third-Party Claim, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.
Such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such Third-Party Claim to the extent then known.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, any such matter as long as the Indemnifying Party pursues the same diligently and in good faith; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.5, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim (and, to the extent the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, shall transfer control of such defense to the Indemnified Party) if (a) such Third-Party Claim seeks equitable relief or such Third-Party Claim involves a criminal action, (b) the Indemnifying Party shall not have assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim within 10 Business Days of receipt of a notice of such Claim for indemnity or (c) such Third-Party Claim exceeds the Indemnity Cap.
If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend, it shall promptly, and in no event later than 10 Business Days, notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in all commercially reasonable respects in the defense thereof.
Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, furnishing the Indemnifying Party with any books, records and other information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the Indemnified Party’s possession or control.
Such cooperation of the Indemnified Party shall be at the cost of the Indemnifying Party.
After the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to defend any such asserted liability, and for so long as the Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any additional legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any defense of such asserted liability; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled (i) at its expense, to participate in the defense of such asserted liability and (ii) if (A) the Indemnifying Party has within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Party provides written notice of a Third-Party Claim, failed (1) to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party or (2) to notify the Indemnified Party of such assumption or (B) if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any indemnified Third-Party Claim without the consent of the - 66 -
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless the settlement thereof, or the entry of any judgment arising therefrom, imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete release from liability of, and does not include any admission of wrongdoing or malfeasance by, the Indemnified Party.
The remedies provided for in this Article VIII are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to a party at law or in equity or otherwise.8.6 Exclusive Remedy.
After the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses related to the breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Article III or Article IV or any covenant to be performed prior to the Closing Date of this Agreement shall be the rights of indemnification set forth in this Article VIII only, and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or otherwise restrict a Fraud claim brought by any party hereto or the right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 10.8(b).8.7 Payment of Indemnification Claims.
To the extent it is finally determined or otherwise agreed upon that any Indemnifying Party is required to provide an indemnification payment pursuant to this Article VIII to any Indemnified Party, such payment shall be made directly by such Indemnifying Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such Indemnified Party, within 10 Business Days of such final determination and designation of account.8.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments.
Any indemnification payments made under this Article VIII shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the relevant Purchaser’s Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.ARTICLE IXTERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER9.1 Termination.
(a) Manner of Termination.
(b) Effect of Termination.
In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of either Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, which rights or obligations will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.9.3 Fees and Expenses.
(a) General.
Except as set forth in this Section 9.3 and Section 10.2(b), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Transaction is consummated.
(b) Company Payments.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Purchaser’s receipt of the Expense Reimbursement shall not act as a waiver of the Company’s obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b)(i).
The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the Transaction, and that the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement, and, therefore, the Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement, if, as and when required pursuant to this Section 9.3, shall not constitute a penalty, but rather liquidated damages, and in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transaction.
(e) Exclusivity of Remedies.
(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to the last sentence of Section 9.3(c) and Section 9.3(d), in the event the Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement to the extent owed described in Section 9.3(b) is paid to the Purchaser or its respective designees, such Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement to the extent owed shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser against (A) the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreement executed in connection herewith to be consummated, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement to the extent owed none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Purchaser may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 9.3(a) and Section 9.3(d), as applicable), other than for Fraud.
The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, subject to the last sentence of Section 9.3(c), in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement to the extent owed on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement to the extent owed may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times or for the occurrence of different events.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, other than in the case of Fraud, in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have liability for monetary damages (including monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) in the aggregate in excess of the amount of the sum of the Company Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement, and Recovery Costs to the extent owed (less any portion thereof that has been paid).
prior to termination, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company and the Company Related Parties against (1) the Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates; and (2) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of the Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (collectively, the “Purchaser Related Parties”) for any losses, damages, costs, expenses, obligations or liabilities arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of such transactions to be consummated) or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or otherwise (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 9.3(a) and Section 9.3(d)).
(iii) While each of the Company and the Purchaser may pursue a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 10.8(b), under no circumstances shall the Company or the Purchaser be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific performance that results in the Closing occurring and (B) any money damages (including the Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement, as applicable).9.4 Amendment.
Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Purchaser and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approvals, no amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the NASDAQ rules without such approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) no Transaction Document shall be amended or waived in any manner that would impair, impede or materially delay the consummation of any Other Transaction (or terminated (other than a termination (excluding a termination due to mutual agreement) in accordance with its terms)) without the prior written consent of the applicable Other Purchaser and (b) any amendment or waiver that expands the rights or limits the obligations or liabilities of the Purchaser hereunder shall, at each Other Purchaser’s option, be deemed to be made with respect to the applicable Other Purchase Agreement and apply to such Other Purchaser.
Each Other Purchaser is an express third-party beneficiary of the prior two sentences of this Section 9.4.9.5 Extension; Waiver.
At any time and from time to time prior to the Closing, either Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of either Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party.
Any delay in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

ARTICLE XGENERAL PROVISIONS10.1 Notices.
The Company agrees that, provided that the Purchaser delivers to the Company a properly executed IRS Form W-9 certifying as to the complete exemption from backup withholding of the Purchaser (or, if the Purchaser is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, its regarded owner), under current Law the Company (including any paying agent of the Company) shall not be required to, and shall not, deduct or withhold Taxes on any payments or deemed payments to the Purchaser.
In the event that the Purchaser fails to deliver to the Company such properly executed IRS Form W-9, the Company reasonably believes that a previously delivered IRS Form W-9 is no longer accurate and/or valid, or there is a change in Law that affects the withholding obligations of the Company, the Company and its paying agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold on all applicable payments made to the Purchaser in the form of cash such Tax amounts as the Company reasonably determines are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of applicable Law (and, to the extent such amounts are paid to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholding was made); provided, that if the Company determines that an amount is required to be deducted or withheld on any payment with respect to the Purchaser, the Company shall provide reasonable prior notice to the Purchaser in writing of its intent to deduct or withhold Taxes on such payment and will reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in obtaining any available exemption or reduction of such withholding.
However, the Company shall not be required to pay any Transfer Tax that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery (or any transfer involved in - 74 -
the issue or delivery) of Purchased Shares or shares of Company Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Purchased Shares to a beneficial owner other than the initial beneficial owner of the Purchased Shares, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the Company the amount of any such Transfer Tax or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such Transfer Tax has been paid or is not payable.
(c) Intended Tax Treatment.
The Purchaser and the Company agree not to treat the Series B Preferred Stock (based on the terms set forth in the Certificate of Designations) as “preferred stock” for purposes of Section 305 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and, as a consequence, neither the Annual Dividends nor the Special Dividend accruing on the Series B Preferred Stock nor any difference between the purchase price paid for the Series B Preferred Stock and the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) thereof will, by reason of Section 305(b)(4) of the Code or Treasury Regulations Section 1.305-5, be treated as a distribution of property until paid in cash.
The Company and the Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates) shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the foregoing intended Tax treatment and shall not take any Tax position that is inconsistent with such intended Tax treatment except in connection with, or as required by, any of the following: (w) a change in relevant Law occurring after the Closing Date, (x) after the Closing Date, the promulgation of relevant final U.S. Treasury Regulations addressing instruments similar to the Series B Preferred Stock (from and after the effective date of such regulations), (y) an amendment to the terms of the Certificate of Designations or (z) a “determination” within the meaning of section 1313(a) of the Code.10.3 Assignment.
No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written approval of the other Party, except that the Purchaser will have the right to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Closing to any of its Affiliates or in connection with a merger or consolidation involving the Purchaser or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Purchaser, it being understood that, such assignment will not (i) relieve the Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the Transaction.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 10.2(a) shall apply in respect of any transferee mutatis mutandis.
No assignment by either Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.
Any purported assignment of this Agreement without the consent required by this Section 10.3 is null and void.10.4 Confidentiality.
The Company and the Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the Company and the Purchaser have previously executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated May 12, 2020 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
The Purchaser and its Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to the Purchaser or its Representatives in connection with the Transaction in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.
- 75 -
10.5 Entire Agreement.
This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements between the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Unless expressly set forth herein, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns and any Indemnified Party hereunder.10.7 Severability.
In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties.
Upon such a determination, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to be only so broad as it is enforceable.10.8 Remedies.
(a) Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance).
Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, the Parties agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.8, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 10.8 shall require any Party hereto to institute any legal action or claim for (or limit any Party’s right to institute any legal action or claim for) injunctive relief or specific performance under this Section 10.8 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article IX (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal action or claim pursuant to this Section 10.8 or anything set forth in this Section 10.8 restrict or limit any Party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article IX or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement or applicable Law that may be available then or thereafter.
- 76 -
(b) Specific Performance.
(i)(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 9.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement (including, without limitation, specific performance of the Parties’ obligations to effect the Closing) is an integral part of the Transaction and without that right, neither the Company nor the Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement.
(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections based on the adequacy of legal remedies or the enforceability of this Section 10.8 to: (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.
Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.
This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated hereby or the actions of the Purchaser or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
- 77 -
10.10 Consent to Jurisdiction.
Each of the Parties: (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transaction, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 10.1 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this Section 10.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, solely if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event of any dispute or controversy relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts unless the Chosen Courts issue a final judgment determining that such court lacks jurisdiction.
The Purchaser and the Company agree that a final judgment and any interim relief (whether equitable or otherwise) in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.10.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.
All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the “Contracting Parties”).
who is not a Contracting Party, including any current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Nonparty Affiliates”), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law: (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.12, nothing in this Section 10.12 shall be deemed to limit any liabilities or obligations of, or claims against, (x) any party to any other Transaction Document or serve as a waiver of any right on the part of any party to such other Transaction Document to initiate any Legal Proceedings permitted by, pursuant to, and in accordance with the specific terms of such other Transaction Document or (y) any Person in respect of Fraud.10.13 Company Disclosure Letter References.
The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular Section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of): (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.10.14 Counterparts.
This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.
No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

A Holder may not convert any shares of Series B Preferred Stock as to which it has elected a Change of Control Put and with respect to which it has not validly withdrawn such election pursuant to Section 9(k).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the failure of the Company to deliver the Initial Change of Control Notice or the Change of Control Put Notice shall not impair the rights of the Holders under this Section 9(b).
(c) Change of Control Put Procedure.
18
(d) Change of Control Call.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Holder exercises the Change of Control Put in part, the Company can exercise the Change of Control Call for the remainder of such Holder’s shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
The Company shall not have the right to elect a Change of Control Call unless, as of the date of delivery of notice of a Change of Control Call, it has set aside sufficient funds legally available for the payment of the full Change of Control Call Price for all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
(f) Treatment of Shares.
Until a share of Series B Preferred Stock is purchased by the payment in full of the applicable Change of Control Put Price or Change of Control Call Price, such share of Series B Preferred Stock will remain outstanding and will be entitled to all of the powers, designations, preferences and other rights provided herein, including that such share (x) may be converted pursuant to Section 6 and in accordance with this Section 9 and, if not so converted, (y) shall (A) accrue Dividends in accordance with Section 4 and (B) entitle the Holder thereof to the voting rights provided in Section 12; provided that any such shares that are converted prior to the consummation of the Change of Control Put or Change of Control Call in accordance with this Certificate of Designations shall not be entitled to receive any payment of the Change of Control Put Price or Change of Control Call Price and shall instead be entitled to the same per share consideration, or the same right to elect per share consideration, as applicable, to be received by holders of Common Stock in connection with the Change of Control (subject to Section 11, as applicable).
19
(g) Partial Exercise of Change of Control Put.
(h) Sufficient Funds.
The inability of the Company (or its successor) to make a purchase payment for any reason shall not relieve the Company (or its successor) from its obligation to effect any required purchase when, as and if permitted by applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Holder elects to exercise a Change of Control Put pursuant to this Section 9 at a time when the Company is restricted or prohibited (contractually or otherwise) from redeeming some or all of the Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Change of Control Put, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite consents to remove or obtain an exception or waiver to such restrictions or prohibition.
Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to comply with its obligations under this Section 9.
In connection with any Change of Control, the Company shall take all actions to permit the purchase of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock on the Change of Control Purchase Date that it reasonably believes is permitted under Delaware law and will not render the Company insolvent (such that, on a consolidated basis, (1) the Company will have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature or become due, (2) the then present fair saleable value of the assets of the Company will not exceed the amount that will be required to pay its probable liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent liabilities) and its debts as they become absolute and matured or (3) the assets of the Company, in each case at a fair valuation, will not exceed its respective debts (including the probable amount of all contingent liabilities)), including revaluing the Company’s assets to the highest amount permitted by law, borrowing funds on prevailing market terms, selling assets on prevailing market terms and seeking to obtain any and all required governmental or other approvals.
The Company shall not take any action that materially impairs the Company’s ability to pay the Change of Control Put Price when due, including by investing available funds in illiquid assets, except for its normal business assets (the covenants described in this Section 9(h), the “Protective Payment Obligations”).
20
(i) Change of Control Agreements.
The Company shall not enter into any agreement for, or otherwise willingly engage in, a transaction constituting a Change of Control unless (i) such agreement provides for or does not interfere with or prevent (as applicable) the exercise by the Holders of their Change of Control Put in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to this Section 9, and (ii) the acquiring or surviving Person in such Change of Control represents or covenants, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Board acting in good faith, that at the closing of such Change of Control that such Person shall have sufficient funds (which may include, without limitation, cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s balance sheet, the proceeds of any debt or equity financing, available lines of credit or uncalled capital commitments) to consummate such Change of Control and the payment of the Change of Control Put Price in respect of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that have not been converted into Common Stock prior to the Change of Control Effective Date pursuant to Section 6 or Section 7, as applicable.
(j) Effect of Change of Control Put/Call.
(l) The above provisions of this Section 9 shall similarly apply to successive Changes of Control (or anticipated Changes of Control).SECTION 10 Anti-Dilution Adjustments.
(a) Adjustments.
The Conversion Factor will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, upon the occurrence of the following events, except that the Company shall not make any adjustment to the Conversion Factor if Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock participate, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of Common Stock and solely as a result of holding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in any transaction described in this Section 10(a), without having to convert their Series B Preferred Stock, as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate multiplied by the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such Holders: 21
If any such event is announced or declared but does not occur, the Conversion Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board announces that such event shall not occur, to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect if such event had not been declared.
CR0 = the Conversion Factor in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuanceCR1 = the new Conversion Factor in effect immediately following the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuanceOS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuanceX = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrantsY = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants divided by the Current Market Price as of the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance.For purposes of this clause (ii), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to purchase the Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the Current Market Price as of the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights, options or warrants, and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be the Fair Market Value thereof.Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall become effective immediately following the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance.
In the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights, options or warrants, to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution or issuance had not been declared.
To the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights, options or warrants upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Factor shall be readjusted to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the dividend, distribution or issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
(iii) The Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries purchases Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (other than an exchange offer that constitutes a Distribution Transaction subject to Section 10(a)(v)) by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock, or otherwise acquires Common Stock (except in connection with tax withholding upon vesting or settlement of options, restricted stock units, performance share units or other similar equity awards or upon forfeiture or cashless exercise of options or other equity awards) (a “Covered Repurchase”), if the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered, exchanged or otherwise acquired through a Covered Repurchase exceeds the arithmetic average of the VWAP 23
If an adjustment to the Conversion Factor is required under this Section 10(a)(iii), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Section 10(a)(iii) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 10(a)(iii).In the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer, exchange offer or other commitment to acquire shares of Common Stock through a Covered Repurchase but is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Factor shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Factor that would have been then in effect if such tender offer, exchange offer or Covered Repurchase had not been made.
24
If any such dividend or distribution is declared but does not occur, the Conversion Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board announces that such dividend or distribution shall not occur, to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(v) The Company effects a Distribution Transaction, in which case the Conversion Factor in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the Distribution Transaction shall be increased based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x [(FMV + MP0) / MP0] 25
If an adjustment to the Conversion Factor is required under this Section 10(a)(v), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Section 10(a)(v) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 10(a)(v).
If any dividend or distribution is declared but not paid, the Conversion Factor shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board announces that such dividend or distribution will not be paid, to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect if such had dividend or distribution not been declared.
(vii) If the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Holders of such shares will receive, in addition to the applicable number of shares of Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan relating to such Common Stock, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have become exercisable or separated from the shares of Common Stock (the first of such events to occur, a “Trigger Event”), in which case, the Conversion Factor will be adjusted, effective automatically at the time of such Trigger Event, as if the Company had made a distribution of such rights to all holders of Common Stock as described in Section 10(a)(ii) (without giving effect to the forty-five (45) day limit on the exercisability of rights, options or warrants ordinarily subject to such Section 10(a)(ii)), subject to appropriate readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights prior to the exercise, deemed exercise or exchange thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such stockholder rights are exchanged by the Company for shares of Common Stock or other property or securities, the Conversion Factor shall be appropriately readjusted as if such stockholder rights had not been issued, but the Company had instead issued such shares of Common Stock or other property or securities as a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) or Section 10(a)(iv), as applicable.To the extent that such rights are not exercised prior to their expiration, termination or redemption, the Conversion Factor shall be readjusted to the Conversion Factor that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event been made on the basis of the issuance of, and the receipt of the exercise price with respect to, only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued pursuant to such rights.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10(a)(vii), no adjustment shall be required to be made to the Conversion Factor with respect to any Holder which is, or is an “affiliate” or “associate” of, an “acquiring person” under such stockholder rights plan or with respect to any direct or indirect transferee of such Holder who receives Series B Preferred Stock in such transfer after the time such Holder becomes, or its affiliate or associate becomes, such an “acquiring person”.
27
(b) Calculation of Adjustments.
No adjustment to the Conversion Factor will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent of the Conversion Factor; provided, however, that any such adjustment that is not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; provided, further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon any Conversion Date or redemption or repurchase date.
(c) When No Adjustment Required.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, the Conversion Factor will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing, or for the repurchase of Common Stock.
(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, the Conversion Factor will not be adjusted as a result of the issuance of, the distribution of separate certificates representing, the exercise or redemption of, or the termination or invalidation of, rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plans.
(iii) No adjustment to the Conversion Factor will be made:(A) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan in which purchases are made at market prices on the date or dates of purchase, without discount, and whether or not the Company bears the ordinary costs of administration and operation of the plan, including brokerage commissions;(B) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security, including the Series B Preferred Stock; or(C) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock.
(d) Successive Adjustments.
After an adjustment to the Conversion Factor under this Section 10, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 10 shall cause an adjustment to each such Conversion Factor as so adjusted.
(e) Multiple Adjustments.
For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Factor pursuant to this Section 10 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder; provided, however, that if more than one subsection of this Section 10 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment.
(f) Notice of Adjustments.
Whenever any event of the type described in this Section 10 has occurred, the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware): 28
(g) Conversion Agent.
The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the Conversion Factor or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same.
The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officer’s Certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 10(g) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate.
The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, that may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Series B Preferred Stock and the Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto.
The Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section 10.
(h) Fractional Shares.
In order to determine whether the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered to a Holder upon the conversion of such Holder’s shares of Series B Preferred Stock will include a fractional share, such determination shall be based on the aggregate number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock of such Holder that are being converted on any single Conversion Date.SECTION 11 Reorganization Events.
(a) Reorganization Events.
In the event of:(i) any reclassification, statutory exchange, merger, consolidation or other similar business combination of the Company with or into another Person, in each case, pursuant to which at least a majority of the Common Stock is changed or converted into, or exchanged for, cash, securities or other property of the Company or another Person; 29
(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or a majority of the property and assets of the Company, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property; or(iii) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or reclassification, recapitalization or reorganization of the Common Stock into other securities;(each of which is referred to as a “Reorganization Event”), each share of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event will, without the consent of the Holders and subject to Section 11(d) and Section 12(b), remain outstanding but shall become convertible into, in accordance with Section 6 and Section 7, the number, kind and amount of securities, cash and other property (the “Exchange Property”) (without any interest on such Exchange Property and without any right to dividends or distributions on such Exchange Property which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Conversion Date) that the Holder of such share of Series B Preferred Stock would have received in such Reorganization Event had such Holder converted its shares of Series B Preferred Stock into the applicable number of shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the effective date of the Reorganization Event using the Conversion Rate applicable immediately prior to the effective date of the Reorganization Event; provided that the foregoing shall not apply if such Holder is a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a “Constituent Person”), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person, to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by such Constituent Persons or such Affiliate thereof.
If the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person (other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof), then for the purpose of this Section 11(a), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon conversion following such Reorganization Event will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock.
(b) Successive Reorganization Events.
The above provisions of this Section 11 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 10 shall apply to any shares of Capital Stock (as though such Capital Stock were Common Stock) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.
(c) Reorganization Event Notice.
(d) Reorganization Event Agreements.
The Company shall not enter into any agreement for a transaction constituting a Reorganization Event unless (i) such agreement provides for or does not interfere with or prevent (as applicable) conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock into the Exchange Property in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to this Section 11, and (ii) to the extent that the Company is not the surviving corporation in such Reorganization 30
Event or will be dissolved in connection with such Reorganization Event, proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such Reorganization Event for the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock into stock of the Person surviving such Reorganization Event or such other continuing entity in such Reorganization Event.SECTION 12 Voting Rights.
(a) General.
Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote as a single class with the holders of the Common Stock and the holders of any other class or series of Capital Stock of the Company then entitled to vote with the Common Stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Common Stock (and, if applicable, holders of any other class or series of Capital Stock of the Company).
The Holders shall be entitled to notice of any meeting of holders of Common Stock in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company.
Each Holder shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the product of (i) the largest number of whole shares of Common Stock into which all shares of Series B Preferred Stock could be converted pursuant to Section 6 multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such Holder and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in each case at and calculated as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote or consent on such matters or, if no such record date is established, at and as of the date such vote or consent is taken or any written consent of stockholders is first executed; provided, that to the extent the Series B Preferred Stock held by any Investor, together with its Permitted Transferees and Affiliates, would, in the aggregate (but without taking into consideration shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by any other Investor, together with its Permitted Transferees and Affiliates), represent voting rights with respect to more than 16.66% of the Company’s Common Stock (including the Series B Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis) (the “Voting Threshold”), such Investor, together with its Permitted Transferees and Affiliates, will not be permitted to exercise the voting rights with respect to any shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by them in excess of the Voting Threshold and the Company shall exercise the voting rights with respect to such shares of Series B Preferred Stock in excess of the Voting Threshold in a Neutral Manner.
To the extent that a Holder acquires shares of Series B Preferred Stock from another Holder, the acquiring Holder’s Voting Threshold will be increased proportionately based on the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that such Holder acquires and the disposing Holder’s Voting Threshold will be decreased proportionately based on the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that such Holder disposes of such that the aggregate Voting Threshold of all Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock does not exceed 49.99%.
(b) Adverse Changes.
In addition to, and not in limitation of, Section 12(a), the vote or consent of the Holders of at least 75% of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at such time, voting together as a separate class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, will be necessary for, directly or indirectly, effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required pursuant to the DGCL: 31
(i) any amendment, alteration or repeal (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation (including this Certificate of Designations) or Bylaws that would have an adverse effect on the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock;(ii) any amendment or alteration (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of, or any supplement (whether by a certificate of designations or otherwise) to, the Certificate of Incorporation or any provision thereof, or any other action to authorize or create, or increase the number of authorized or issued shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, or reclassify any security into, or issue, any Parity Stock or Senior Stock or any other class or series of Capital Stock of the Company ranking senior to, or on a parity basis with, the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights or rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company; or(iii) any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock after the Issuance Date,provided that the authorization or creation of, or the increase in the number of authorized or issued shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, or the reclassification of any security (other than the Series B Preferred Stock) into, or the issuance of, Junior Stock will not require the vote the Holders pursuant to this Section 12(b).
For purposes of this Section 12(b), the filing in accordance with applicable law of a certificate of designations or any similar document setting forth or changing the designations, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of any class or series of stock of the Company shall be deemed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.
(c) Each Holder of Series B Preferred Stock will have one vote per share on any matter on which Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class, whether at a meeting or by written consent.
(d) The vote or consent of the Holders of 75% of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at such time, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, will be sufficient to waive or amend the provisions of Section 9(i) of this Certificate of Designations, and any amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 9(i) approved by such percentage of the Holders shall be binding on all of the Holders.
(e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, the Holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive consent and voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) and may take action or consent to any action with respect to such rights without a meeting by delivering a consent in writing or by electronic transmission of the Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize, take or consent to such action at a meeting of stockholders.
(f) Upon the acquisition of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the Holder of such shares shall be deemed to irrevocably appoint as its proxy and attorney-in-fact, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel of the Company, each of them individually, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to consent to or vote any shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by them in excess of the Voting Threshold as indicated in Section 12(a) above with respect to any matters that must be voted in a Neutral Manner.
32
SECTION 13 Term.
Except as expressly provided in this Certificate of Designations, the shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable or otherwise mature and the term of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be perpetual.SECTION 14 Creation of Capital Stock.
Subject to the Consent Provisions and Section 12(b), the Board, or any duly authorized committee thereof, without the vote of the Holders, may authorize and issue additional shares of Capital Stock of the Company.SECTION 15 No Sinking Fund.
Shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be subject to or entitled to the operation of a retirement or sinking fund.SECTION 16 Transfer Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar and Paying Agent.
The duly appointed Transfer Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar and paying agent for the Series B Preferred Stock shall be American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
The Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint any other Person to serve as Transfer Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar or paying agent for the Series B Preferred Stock and thereafter may remove or replace such other Person at any time.
33
SECTION 18 Taxes.
The Company agrees that, provided that a Holder delivers to the Company a properly executed IRS Form W-9 certifying as to the complete exemption from backup withholding of the Holder (or, if the Holder is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, its regarded owner), under current law the Company (including any paying agent of the Company) shall not be required to, and shall not, deduct or withhold taxes on any payments or deemed payments to any such Holder.
In the event that any such Holder fails to deliver to the Company such properly executed IRS Form W-9, the Company reasonably believes that a previously delivered IRS Form W-9 is no longer accurate and/or valid, or there is a change in law that affects the withholding obligations of the Company, the Company and its paying agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold on all applicable payments made to the relevant Holder in the form of cash such tax amounts as the Company reasonably determines are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of applicable law (and, to the extent such amounts are paid to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Certificate of Designations as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholding was made); provided, that if the Company determines that an amount is required to be deducted or withheld on any payment with respect to any Holder, the Company shall provide reasonable prior notice to such Holder in writing of its intent to deduct or withhold taxes on such payment and will reasonably cooperate with such Holder in obtaining any available exemption or reduction of such withholding.
The Company shall pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes due upon the issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant hereto.
However, in the case of conversion of Series B Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock to a beneficial owner other than the initial beneficial owner of Series B Preferred Stock, and shall not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the Person requesting such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
(c) Tax Treatment.
It is intended that (i) the Series B Preferred Stock shall not be treated as “preferred stock” for purposes of Section 305 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) as a consequence, neither the Annual Dividends nor the Special Dividend accruing on the Series B Preferred Stock nor any difference between the purchase price paid for the Series B Preferred Stock and the Liquidation Preference thereof will, by reason of Section 305(b)(4) of the Code or Treasury Regulations Section 1.305-5, be treated as a distribution of property until paid in cash.
The Company and Holders (and their respective affiliates) shall file all tax returns in a manner consistent with the foregoing intended tax treatment and shall not take any tax position that is inconsistent with such intended tax treatment except in connection with, or as required by, any of the following: (w) a change in relevant law occurring after the Original Issuance Date, (x) after the Original Issuance Date, the promulgation of relevant final U.S. Treasury Regulations addressing instruments similar to the Series B Preferred Stock (from and after the effective date of such regulations), (y) an amendment to the terms of this Certificate of Designations or (z) a “determination” within the meaning of section 1313(a) of the Code.
34
When the terms of this Certificate of Designations refer to a specific agreement or other document to determine the meaning or operation of a provision hereof, the Secretary of the Company shall maintain a copy of such agreement or document at the principal executive offices of the Company and a copy thereof shall be provided free of charge to any Holder who makes a request therefor.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, any provision contained herein and any right of the Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock granted hereunder may be waived as to all shares of Series B Preferred Stock (and the Holders thereof) upon the vote or written consent of the Holders of a majority of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding.SECTION 22 Severability.
If any term of the Series B Preferred Stock set forth herein is invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public policy, all other terms set forth herein which can be given effect without the invalid, unlawful or unenforceable term will, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, and no term herein set forth will be deemed dependent upon any other such term unless so expressed herein.SECTION 23 Business Opportunities.
To the fullest extent permitted by Section 122(17) of the DGCL (or any successor provision) and except as may be otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Company and the Investor Parties, the Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company and its Subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities, that are from time to time presented to the Investor Parties or any of their respective officers, representatives, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, Affiliates, Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), or any of their respective designees on the Company’s Board and/or any of their respective representatives who, from time to time, may act as officers of the Company, even if the opportunity is one that the Company or its Subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person shall be liable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to the Company or its Subsidiaries unless such business opportunity is disclosed to the applicable director or officer in his or her capacity as such.
Any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of Capital Stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the 35
provisions of this Section 23.

Capitalized terms used but not defined elsewhere herein are defined in Exhibit A.
If the Resale Shelf Registration Statement is not an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the filing thereof.

Section 1.2 Effectiveness Period.
Once declared effective, the Company shall, subject to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be continuously effective and usable until such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities (the “Effectiveness Period”).Section 1.3 Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement.
If any Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective under the Securities Act for any reason at any time during the Effectiveness Period, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable cause such Shelf Registration Statement to again become effective under the Securities Act (including obtaining the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable amend such Shelf Registration Statement in a manner reasonably expected to result in the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement or file an additional registration statement (a “Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement”) for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the resale from time to time by the Holders thereof of all securities that are Registrable Securities as of the time of such filing.
If a Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement is filed, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (a) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the filing thereof (it being agreed that if the Company is a WKSI as of the filing date, the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, or a prospectus supplement to an effective Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, that shall become effective upon filing with the SEC pursuant to Rule 462(e)) and (b) keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and usable until the end of the Effectiveness Period.

In making the determination to consent to the Holder or Holders’, as applicable, choice of managing underwriter(s), the Company may take into account its business and strategic interests.
The Company and the Holders participating in an Underwritten Offering will enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering.

(d) The Company will not include in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Section 1.6 any securities that are not Registrable Securities (other than the WPP Securities) without the prior written consent of the Holder(s) participating in such Underwritten Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such underwritten offering advise the Company in writing that in its or their good faith opinion the number of securities exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in such offering in light of market conditions or is such so as to adversely affect the success of such offering, the Company will include in such offering only such number of securities that can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, which securities will be so included in the following order of priority: (i) first, the securities proposed to be sold by the Company for its own account; (ii) second, the Registrable Securities of the Holders that have requested to participate in such underwritten offering and any other persons with piggyback registration rights who have the right to participate and that have requested to participate in such offering, allocated pro rata among such selling holders on the basis of their respective then-owned registrable securities; and (iii) third, any other securities of the Company that have been requested to be included in such offering, allocated pro rata among such holders on the basis of the percentage of securities then held by such holders; provided that Holders may, prior to the earlier of (a) the effectiveness of the registration statement and (b) the time at which the offering price or underwriter’s discount is determined with the managing underwriter or underwriters, withdraw their request to be included in such registration pursuant to this Section 1.8.ARTICLE IIADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING REGISTRATION RIGHTSSection 2.1 Registration Procedures.

Section 3.3 Notification.
If any Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article III (each, an “Indemnified Party”), such Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice to the party required to provide indemnification (each, an “Indemnifying Party”) of any claim or of the commencement of any proceeding as to which indemnity is sought.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party as promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt of written notice from such Indemnified Party of such claim or proceeding, to, unless in the Indemnified Party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, assume, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, the defense of any such claim or litigation, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such Indemnified Party hereunder for any legal expenses and other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such claim or litigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party (i) agrees to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) shall have failed within a reasonable period of time to assume, or in the event of a conflict of interest cannot assume, such defense or shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party.
The failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall relieve an Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article III only to the extent that the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial or harmful to such Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such action.
No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the prior written consent of each Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not (x) include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or (y) involve the imposition of equitable remedies or the imposition of any obligations on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects such Indemnified Party other than as a result of financial obligations for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder.
The indemnity agreements contained in this Article III shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, loss, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The indemnification set forth in this Article III shall be in addition to any other indemnification rights or agreements that an Indemnified Party may have.
An Indemnifying Party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with one local counsel, if appropriate) for all parties indemnified by such Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any Indemnified Party a conflict of interest may exist between such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Parties with respect to such claim.Section 3.4 Contribution.
If the indemnification provided for in this Article III is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party, other than pursuant to its terms, with respect to any Losses or action referred to therein, then, subject to the limitations contained in this Article III, the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other 14
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made (or omitted) by, or relates to information supplied by such Indemnifying Party or such Indemnified Party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission.
The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 3.4 was determined solely upon pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 3.4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount any Purchaser or any Holder will be obligated to contribute pursuant to this Section 3.4 will be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by such Purchaser or Holder in respect of the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the registration statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.ARTICLE IVTRANSFER AND TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION RIGHTSSection 4.1 Transfer of Registration Rights.

No party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.Section 5.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary.

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 5.7 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.Section 5.8 Waiver of Jury Trial.

Upon such a determination, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to be only so broad as it is enforceable.Section 5.11 Expenses.

Stockholder or its Affiliates will serve on the board of directors (or its equivalent) of such other issuer pursuant to the terms of an agreement to which the Company is a party (or if the Stockholder notifies the Company of such service a reasonable time in advance of the closing of such transactions), the Company shall require that such other issuer preapprove any such acquisitions of equity securities or derivatives thereof for the express purpose of exempting the interests of such Stockholder, its Affiliates and the Director designated by such Stockholder (for the Stockholder and/or its Affiliates, to the extent such persons may be deemed to be “directors by deputization” of such other issuer) in such transactions from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 thereunder.Section 2.2 Director Compensation; Indemnification.

(b) The Company shall indemnify the Directors and provide such Directors with director and officer insurance to the same extent as it indemnifies and provides such insurance to other members of the Board, pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, the DGCL or otherwise.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that it (i) is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the Directors are primary and any obligation of the Stockholder or its Affiliates to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by Directors designated by such Stockholder are secondary) and (ii) shall be required to advance the amount of expenses incurred by Directors and shall be liable for the amount of all expenses and liabilities incurred by a Director, in each case to the same extent as it advances expenses and is liable for expenses and liabilities incurred by the other members of the Board, pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, the DGCL or otherwise, without regard to any rights that a Director may have against any Stockholder or its Affiliates.
(c) Each Stockholder and the Company hereby agree, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement or at law or in equity, that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, when such Stockholder or any of its Permitted Transferees takes any action under this Agreement to give or withhold their consent, such Persons shall have no duty (fiduciary or other) to consider the interests of the Company or the other stockholders of the Company and may act exclusively in their own interest; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no way affect the obligations of the parties hereto to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.Section 2.3 Observers.
(a) For so long as a Stockholder beneficially owns Voting Stock representing at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis), such Stockholder shall be entitled to appoint one individual to attend and observe meetings of the Board or any committee thereof in a non-voting capacity (such individuals, “Observers”).
Under no circumstances shall any Observers be counted for purposes of voting, quorum or any other reason or be considered a Director.
Each Observer shall agree to maintain the confidentiality of all non-public information and proceedings of the Board pursuant to the terms and conditions of a confidentiality agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Notwithstanding any rights to be granted or provided to the Observers hereunder, the Company may exclude an Observer from access to any Board or committee materials or information or meeting or portion thereof or written consent if the Board or applicable 17
committee determines, in good faith, that including such Observer in discussions relating to such determination (but not requiring the affirmative vote of such Observer) and/or that such access would reasonably be expected to (i) adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company, the Board or any committee thereof and such Person’s counsel, (ii) result in a conflict of interest with the Company (other than a conflict of interest with respect to the relevant Stockholder’s ownership interest in the Company or rights under the documents entered into in connection with the Transactions) or (iii) cause the Board (or such committee) to breach its fiduciary duties; provided, that such exclusion shall be limited to the portion of the Board or committee material or information and/or meeting or written consent that is the basis for such exclusion and shall not extend to any portion of the Board or committee material or information and/or meeting or written consent that does not involve or pertain to such exclusion; provided that the Board shall treat all similarly situated Observers equally such that no Observer shall be excluded unless all other Observers whose participation in such meeting of the Board, or portions thereof, or receipt of such information, or portions thereof, would result in a similar concern are also excluded.
The decision of the Board (or such committee) shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, and each Stockholder hereby waives any objection to such decision and agrees to cause its applicable Observer to not interpose any objection to any such decision.
The Observers will not be entitled to compensation from the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary provided elsewhere herein, (x) the Company shall not be required to take any action that the Company reasonably believes may be prohibited by applicable law, or any action that the Company reasonably believes may constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law and (y) the Company may delay, for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 20 business days, the transactions contemplated by a Stockholder’s request pursuant to this Section 3.5 if pursuing and/or consummating such transaction at such time is not, in the good faith opinion of the Board, in the best interest of the Company because it would (1) materially impede, delay or interfere with any material pending or proposed financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Company, (2) materially adversely impair the consummation of any pending or proposed material offering or sale of any class of securities by the Company or (3) require disclosure of material nonpublic information that, if disclosed at such time, would be materially harmful to the interests of the Company and its stockholders.

Capital Stock the Company is not required to offer to the Qualified Stockholders pursuant to the first sentence of Section 4.2(a)).

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be permitted to sell Capital Stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering program without first offering such Capital Stock to the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 4.2; provided that promptly following such sale, each Stockholder shall be offered the right to purchase Capital Stock in such amount necessary to achieve the same economic effect to such Stockholder as contemplated by, and subject to, this Section 4.2, if such offer would have been made prior to such sale; provided that in such case there shall be deemed to be no dilution to the Preemptive Percentage (or equivalent concepts used to measure or describe the Stockholder’s percentage ownership of the Common Stock on an as-converted basis) for any purpose under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2.1, Section 3.3 and Section 4.2) of any Stockholder who did not purchase the shares of Capital Stock at the time of the initial sale in such at-the-market offering as a result of the application of Section 4.2(f) until such Stockholder has exercised or declined to exercise or waived its rights under the first proviso of this Section 4.2(f) with respect to such proposed issuance of Capital Stock and, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any such decline to exercise or waiver of rights under the first proviso of this Section 4.2(f), the Preemptive Percentage shall be diluted accordingly.
