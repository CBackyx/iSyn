Delay Payments shall be pro-rated for periods of less than 30 days.
“Demand Date” shall mean the date when at least two-thirds (2/3) of the holders in interest of the Warrants outstanding deliver notice to the Company of their demand that the Company file a Registration Statement with the SEC pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
“Per Share Market Value” shall mean on any particular date (a) the closing bid price per share of the Common Stock on such date on the Approved Market on which the Common Stock is then listed or if there is no such price on such date, then the closing bid price on such exchange or quotation system on the date nearest preceding such date, or (b) if the Common Stock is not listed then on the Nasdaq National Market or any stock exchange or quotation system, the closing bid price for a share of Common Stock in the over-the-counter market, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated or similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices at the close of business on such date, or (c) if the Common Stock is not then reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated (or similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices), then the average of the “Pink Sheet” quotes for the relevant conversion period, as determined in good faith by the holder, or (d) if the Common Stock is not then publicly traded the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by an Appraiser selected in good faith by the holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Notes and paid for by the Company; provided, however, that the Company, after receipt of the determination by such appraiser, shall have the right to select an additional Appraiser (which may be the firm of independent accountants that regularly reviews the Company’s financial statements), in which case, the fair market value shall be equal to the average of the determinations by each such Appraiser.
Such best efforts by the Company shall include the following:          (a) The Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible after a Demand Date:     (i)  But in any event within 30 days thereafter (“Filing Deadline”), prepare and file a registration statement with the Commission on Form S-3 under the Securities Act (or in the event that the Company is ineligible to use such form, such other form as the Company is eligible to use under the Securities Act) covering the Registrable Securities (such registration statement, including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein, is referred to herein as the “Registration Statement”), which Registration Statement, to the extent allowable under the Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416), shall state that such Registration Statement also covers such number of additional shares of Common Stock as may become issuable to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar events.
(iii)  After the registration, furnish to each Holder such numbers of copies of a current prospectus conforming with the requirements of the Act, copies of the Registration Statement, any amendment or supplement thereto and any documents incorporated by reference therein and such other documents as such Holder may reasonably require in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by such Holder.
Each Holder shall exercise such right by providing the Company with written notice thereof (the “Put Notice”), which such Put Notice shall include the type and amount of each security that the Holder seeks to redeem and a date at least ten (10) days from the date thereof on which the Holder seeks the redemption to occur (the “Redemption Date”).
(ii)  No Listing; Premium Price Redemption for Delisting of Class of Shares.
(v)  Delay Payment and Put Terms; Status of Unpaid Delay Payments.
        with the above provisions shall be paid at any time upon demand, by the tenth (10th) day of each calendar month for the partial or full calendar month occurring prior to that date.
(iii)  cause to be delivered, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (and, in the case of an underwritten offering, at the time of delivery of any Registrable Securities sold pursuant thereto), and at the beginning of each fiscal year following a year during which the Company’s independent certified public accountants shall have reviewed any of the Company’s books or records, a “comfort” letter from the Company’s independent certified public accountants addressed to the Holders and each underwriter, if any, stating that such accountants are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder, and otherwise in customary form and covering such financial and accounting matters as are customarily covered by letters of the independent certified public accountants delivered in connection with secondary offerings; such accountants shall have undertaken in each such letter to update the same during each such fiscal year in which such books or records are being reviewed so that each such letter shall remain current, correct and complete throughout such fiscal year; and each such letter and update thereof, if any, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders.
     (iv)  if an underwriting agreement is entered into, the same shall include customary indemnification and contribution provisions to and from the underwriters and procedures for secondary underwritten offerings;     (v)  deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of the Registrable Securities being sold or the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to evidence compliance with clause (i) above and with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, if any; and     (vi)  deliver to the Holders on the effective day (or in the case of an underwritten offering, dated the date of delivery of any Registrable Securities sold pursuant thereto) of the Registration Statement, and at the beginning of each fiscal quarter thereafter, a certificate in form and substance as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders, executed by an executive officer of the Company and to the effect that all the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Purchase Agreement are still true and correct except as disclosed in such certificate; the Company shall, as to each such certificate delivered at the beginning of each fiscal quarter, update or cause to be updated each such certificate during such quarter so that it shall remain current, complete and correct throughout such quarter; and such updates received by the Holders during such quarter, if any, shall have been reasonably satisfactory to the Holders.
(e) The Company shall make available for inspection, upon reasonable written notice and during regular business hours, by the Holders, representative(s) of all the Holders together, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to a Registration Statement, and any attorney or accountant retained by any Holder or underwriter, all financial and other records customary for purposes of the Holders’ due diligence examination of the Company and review of any Registration Statement, all SEC Documents (as defined in the Loan Agreement) filed subsequent to the issuance of the Warrants, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the Company’s officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such representative, underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with such Registration Statement, provided that such parties agree to keep such information confidential.
(f) If requested by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Holders in interest of the Warrants outstanding, the Company shall file a Registration Statement with respect to any newly authorized and/or reserved shares, with respect to its obligation to reserve or register Registrable Securities, within 30 days of any corporate action authorizing or reserving same and shall file a Registration Statement with respect to additional Registrable Securities within 30 days of the occurrence of an event referred to in Section 2(a)(x) and shall use its best efforts to cause, in either case, such Registration Statement to become effective within seventy-five (75) days of such corporate action or such occurrence, as the case may be.
Registration on Form S-3; Other Forms.
The certificate(s) representing the Warrant Shares held by the Lender (or then Holder) may be exchanged by the Lender (or such Holder) at any time and from time to time for certificates with different denominations representing an equal aggregate number of Warrant Shares, as reasonably requested by the Lender (or such Holder) upon surrendering the same.
