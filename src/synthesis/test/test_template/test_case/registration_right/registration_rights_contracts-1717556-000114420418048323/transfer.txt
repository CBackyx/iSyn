The Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to the Registrable Securities and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement relating to the Registrable Securities to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing (but in no event later than the Effectiveness Deadline).

f.            The Company shall notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in writing of the happening of any event, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, as a result of which the prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material, nonpublic information), and, subject to Section 3(r), promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver ten (10) copies of such supplement or amendment to Legal Counsel and each Investor (or such other number of copies as Legal Counsel or such Investor may reasonably request).
The Company shall also promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in writing (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to Legal Counsel and each Investor by facsimile or e-mail on the same day of such effectiveness and by overnight mail), (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related prospectus or related information, and (iii) of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate.

n.           The Company shall make generally available to its security holders as soon as practical, but not later than ninety (90) days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with, and in the manner provided by, the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date of a Registration Statement.
p.           On the date hereof, the Company shall furnish instructions to its transfer agent in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

r.            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time after the Effective Date, the Company may delay the disclosure of material, non-public information concerning the Company if the disclosure of such information at the time is not, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company and its counsel, in the best interest of the Company and, in the opinion of counsel to the Company otherwise required (a “Grace Period”); provided, that the Company shall promptly (i) notify the Investors in writing of the existence of material, non-public information giving rise to a Grace Period (provided that in each notice the Company will not disclose the content of such material, non-public information to the Investors) and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, and (ii) notify the Investors in writing of the date on which the Grace Period ends; and, provided further, that no Grace Period shall exceed five (5) consecutive trading days and during any three hundred sixty five (365) day period such Grace Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of thirty (30) trading days, and the first day of any Grace Period must be at least two (2) trading days after the last day of any prior Grace Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of an Investor in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which an Investor has entered into a contract for sale and delivered a copy of the prospectus included as part of the applicable Registration Statement (unless an exemption from such prospectus delivery requirement exists) prior to the Investor's receipt of the notice of a Grace Period and for which the Investor has not yet settled.
At least five (5) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement, the Company shall notify each Investor in writing of the information the Company requires from each such Investor in order to have any of such Investor’s Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement, including an Accredited Investor Questionnaire and a certified statement as to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Investor and any affiliate thereof, (ii) any FINRA affiliations, (iii) any natural persons who have the power to vote or dispose of any shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Investor and any affiliate thereof, and (iv) any other information as may be requested by the SEC, FINRA or any state securities commission.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of an Investor in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which an Investor has entered into a contract for sale prior to the Investor's receipt of a notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in the first sentence of Section 3(f), Section 3(g) or Section 3(r) and for which the Investor has not yet settled.
c.           Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses of not more than one counsel for such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party, as the case may be, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.
c.           furnish to each Investor so long as such Investor owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) if not available on EDGAR, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (ii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the Investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration.
