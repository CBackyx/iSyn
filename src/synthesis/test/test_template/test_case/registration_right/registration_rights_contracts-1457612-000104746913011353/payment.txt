Purchase Price; Number of Shares.
(a)                                 The registered holder of this Warrant (the “Holder”), is entitled upon surrender of this Warrant with the subscription form annexed hereto duly executed, at the principal office of the Company, to purchase from the Company, at a price per share of $0.58 (the “Purchase Price”), up to a maximum of 517,242 fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value (the “Preferred Stock”).
Commencing on the date hereof, 258,621 (the “Exercise Quantity”) of shares of Preferred Stock are immediately available for purchase hereunder.
(b)                                 On the Commitment Termination Date, the Exercise Quantity shall automatically be increased by such additional number of shares as is equal to (A) 3% of the amount of Aggregate Advances funded under the Loan Agreement, if any, divided by (B) the Purchase Price.
Payment of Purchase Price.
The Purchase Price may be paid (i) in cash or by check, (ii) by the surrender by the Holder to the Company of any promissory notes or other obligations issued by the Company, with all such notes and obligations so surrendered being credited against the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date of surrender, or (iii) by any combination of the foregoing.
The Holder may elect to receive, without the payment by the Holder of any additional consideration, shares of Preferred Stock equal to the value of this Warrant or any portion hereof by the surrender of this Warrant or such portion to the Company, with the net issue election notice annexed hereto duly executed, at the principal office of the Company.
Thereupon, the Company shall issue to the Holder such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Preferred Stock as is computed using the following formula:
“Fair Market Value” of a share of Preferred Stock (or fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.001 par value (the “Common Stock”) if the Preferred Stock has been automatically converted into Common Stock) as of the date that the net issue election is made (the “Determination Date”) shall mean: (i)                                    If the net issue election is made in connection with and contingent upon the closing of the sale of the Company’s Common Stock to the public in a public offering pursuant to a Registration Statement under the 1933 Act (a “Public Offering”), and if the Company’s Registration Statement relating to such Public Offering (“Registration Statement”) has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, then the initial “Price to Public” specified in the final prospectus with respect to such offering multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock is then convertible.
If, upon exercise of this Warrant in its entirety, the Holder would, except as provided in this Section 6, be entitled to receive a fractional share of Preferred Stock, then the Company shall make a cash payment therefor upon the basis of the Purchase Price then in effect.
If after the date hereof the Company shall subdivide the Preferred Stock, by split-up or otherwise, or combine the Preferred Stock, or issue additional shares of Preferred Stock in payment of a stock dividend on the Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable on the exercise of this Warrant shall forthwith be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision or stock dividend, or proportionately decreased in the case of a combination, and the Purchase Price shall forthwith be proportionately decreased in the case of a subdivision or stock dividend, or proportionately increased in the case of a combination.
If the Company shall effect a firm commitment underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock which results in the conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to the Company’s Articles in effect immediately prior to such offering, then, effective upon such conversion, this Warrant shall change from the right to purchase shares of Preferred Stock to the right to purchase shares of Common Stock, and the Holder shall thereupon have the right to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of this Warrant in full, the number of shares of Common Stock which would have been receivable by the Holder upon the exercise of this Warrant for shares of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, and in such event appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of the Holder to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, the provisions for the adjustment of the Purchase Price and of the number of shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant and the provisions relating to the net issue election) shall thereafter be applicable to any shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise hereof.
The Company and the Holder agree that the value of this Warrant on the date of grant is $100.

Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $0.58 plus all accrued but unpaid dividends on the date of conversion (with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock) (the “Series B Original Issue Price”), provided, however, that all holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive such dividends in cash at the time of conversion upon such an election by the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in which case the Series B Original Issue Price shall be $0.58; $0.65 (with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock) (the “Series A Original Issue Price”); and $0.65 (with respect to Seed Preferred Stock) (each as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Seed Preferred Stock) by the Series B Preferred Conversion Price, Series A Preferred Conversion Price and Seed Preferred Conversion Price, respectively, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion.
