Section 2.03.
Representations and Warranties of the Depositor.
(a)The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee, for the benefit of Certificateholders, and to the Master Servicer, as of the Closing Date or such other date as is specified, that:(i)the Depositor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws governing its creation and existence and has full corporate power and authority to own its property, to carry on its business as presently conducted, to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and to create the trust pursuant hereto;(ii)the execution and delivery by the Depositor of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Depositor; neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions hereof, will conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any of the provisions of any law, governmental rule, regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Depositor or its properties or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Depositor;(iii)the execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not require the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of, any state, federal or other governmental authority or agency, except such as has been obtained, given, effected or taken prior to the date hereof;(iv)this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Depositor and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee and the Master Servicer, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Depositor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors generally and (B) general principles of equity regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;(v)there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Depositor, threatened or likely to be asserted against or affecting the Depositor, before or by any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or governmental body (A) with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) with respect to any other matter which in the judgment of the Depositor will be determined adversely to the Depositor and will if determined adversely to the Depositor materially and adversely affect it or its business, assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise, or adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement; and(vi)immediately prior to the transfer and assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee, the Depositor was the sole owner of record and holder of each Mortgage Loan, and the Depositor had good and marketable title thereto, and had full right to transfer and sell each Mortgage Loan to the Trustee free and clear, subject only to (1) liens of current real property taxes and assessments not yet due and payable and, if the related Mortgaged Property is a condominium unit, any lien for common charges permitted by statute, (2) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record as of the date of recording of such Mortgage acceptable to mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the related Mortgaged Property is located and specifically referred to in the lender’s Title Insurance Policy or attorney’s opinion of title and abstract of title delivered to the originator of such Mortgage Loan, and (3) such other matters to which like properties are commonly subject which do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage, of any encumbrance, equity, participation interest, lien, pledge, charge, claim or security interest, and had full right and authority, subject to no interest or participation of, or agreement with, any other party, to sell and assign each Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Agreement.
(b)The representations and warranties of each Transferor with respect to the related Mortgage Loans in the applicable Transfer Agreement, which have been assigned to the Trustee hereunder, were made as of the date specified in the applicable Transfer Agreement (or underlying agreement, if such Transfer Agreement is in the form of an assignment of a prior agreement).
To the extent that any fact, condition or event with respect to a Mortgage Loan constitutes a breach of both (i) a representation or warranty of the applicable Transferor under the applicable Transfer Agreement and (ii) a representation or warranty of Lehman Capital or Lehman Bank, as applicable, under the related Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement, the only right or remedy of the Trustee or of any Certificateholder shall be the Trustee’s right to enforce the obligations of the applicable Transferor under any applicable representation or warranty made by it.
The Trustee acknowledges that Lehman Capital or Lehman Bank, as applicable, shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty made by it with respect to the Mortgage Loans if the fact, condition or event constituting such breach also constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty made by the applicable Transferor in the applicable Transfer Agreement, without regard to whether such Transferor fulfills its contractual obligations in respect of such representation or warranty.
The Trustee further acknowledges that the Depositor shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty with respect to the Mortgage Loans (except as set forth in Section 2.03(a)(vi)) under any circumstances.Section 2.04.
Discovery of Breach.It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties (i) set forth in Section 2.03, (ii) of Lehman Capital or of Lehman Bank set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement and assigned to the Trustee by the Depositor hereunder and (iii) of each Transferor, assigned by Lehman Capital or by Lehman Bank, as applicable, to the Depositor pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement and assigned to the Trustee by the Depositor hereunder shall each survive delivery of the Mortgage Files and the Assignment of Mortgage of each Mortgage Loan to the Trustee and shall continue throughout the term of this Agreement.
Upon discovery by any of the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee of a breach of any of such representations and warranties that adversely and materially affects the value of the related Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties.
In the event of discovery of a breach of any representation and warranty of any Transferor assigned to the Trustee, the Trustee shall enforce its rights under the applicable Transfer Agreement and the related Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement for the benefit of Certificateholders.
As provided in each Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement, if any Transferor substitutes for a Mortgage Loan for which there is a breach of any representations and warranties in the related Transfer Agreement which adversely and materially affects the value of such Mortgage Loan and such substitute mortgage loan is not a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, under the terms of such Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement, either Lehman Capital or Lehman Bank, as applicable, will, in exchange for such Substitute Mortgage Loan, (i) provide the applicable Purchase Price for the affected Mortgage Loan or (ii) within two years of the Closing Date, substitute such affected Mortgage Loan with a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan.Section 2.05.
(a)With respect to any Mortgage Loan repurchased by the Depositor pursuant to this Agreement, by Lehman Capital or Lehman Bank pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement or by any Transferor pursuant to the applicable Transfer Agreement, the principal portion of the funds received by the Trustee in respect of such repurchase of a Mortgage Loan will be considered a Principal Prepayment and shall be deposited in the Collection Account.
Each Seller indemnifies and holds the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Depositor and each Certificateholder harmless against any and all taxes, claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Depositor and any Certificateholder may sustain in connection with any actions of the related Seller relating to a repurchase of a Mortgage Loan other than in compliance with the terms of this Section 2.05 and the related Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement, to the extent that any such action causes (i) any federal or state tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund, including without limitation, any federal tax imposed on “prohibited transactions” under Section 860F(2) of the Code, or (ii) any REMIC created hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.
As soon as practicable after the delivery of any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan hereunder, the Trustee, at the expense of the Depositor and at the direction and with the cooperation of the applicable Servicer, shall, with respect to a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan that is a Non-MERS Mortgage Loan, cause the Assignment of Mortgage to be recorded by such Servicer if required pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(i), or the Servicer shall, with respect to a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan that is a MERS Mortgage Loan, cause to be taken such actions as are necessary to cause the Trustee to be clearly identified as the owner of each such Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS if required pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(ii).
(c)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the right to substitute Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Article II shall be subject to the additional limitations that no substitution of a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan for a Deleted Mortgage Loan shall be made unless the Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to make the substitution) that, under current law, such substitution will not (A) affect adversely the status of any REMIC established hereunder as a REMIC, or of the related “regular interests” as “regular interests” in any such REMIC, or (B) cause any such REMIC to engage in a prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution pursuant to the REMIC Provisions.Section 2.06.
Grant Clause.
(a)It is intended that the conveyance of the Depositor’s right, title and interest in and to property constituting the Trust Fund pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute, and shall be construed as, a sale of such property and not a grant of a security interest to secure a loan.
However, if such conveyance is deemed to be in respect of a loan, it is intended that:  (1) the rights and obligations of the parties shall be established pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (2) the Depositor hereby grants to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Certificates a first priority security interest to secure repayment of an obligation in an amount equal to the aggregate Class Principal Amount of the Certificates in all of the Depositor’s right, title and interest in, to and under, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, the Trust Fund and all proceeds of any and all property constituting the Trust Fund to secure payment of the Certificates; and (3) this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.
If such conveyance is deemed to be in respect of a loan and the Trust created by this Agreement terminates prior to the satisfaction of the claims of any Person holding any Certificate, the security interest created hereby shall continue in full force and effect and the Trustee shall be deemed to be the collateral agent for the benefit of such Person, and all proceeds shall be distributed as herein provided.
(b)The Depositor shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such reasonable actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans and the other property described above, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Depositor shall prepare and forward for filing, or shall cause to be forwarded for filing, at the expense of the Depositor, all filings necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings necessary under the relevant UCC to perfect the Trustee’s security interest in or lien on the Mortgage Loans, including without limitation (x) continuation statements, and (y) such other statements as may be occasioned by (1) any change of name of the Sellers, the Depositor or the Trustee, (2) any change of location of the jurisdiction of organization of the Sellers or the Depositor, (3) any transfer of any interest of the Sellers or the Depositor in any Mortgage Loan or (4) any change under the relevant UCC or other applicable laws.
Neither the Sellers nor the Depositor shall organize under the law of any jurisdiction other than the State under which each is organized as of the Closing Date (whether changing its jurisdiction of organization or organizing under an additional jurisdiction) without giving 30 days prior written notice of such action to its transferee, including the Trustee.
Before effecting such change, the Sellers or the Depositor proposing to change its jurisdiction of organization shall prepare and file in the appropriate filing office any financing statements or other statements necessary to continue the perfection of the interests of its transferees, including the Trustee, in the Mortgage Loans.
In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Sellers and the Depositor authorizes its transferee to file in any filing office any initial financing statements, any amendments to financing statements, any continuation statements, or any other statements or filings described in this paragraph (b).ARTICLE III  THE CERTIFICATESSection 3.01.

In the event that the total amount of such recovery exceeds the amount of Realized Loss allocated to the outstanding Classes or Components in accordance with the preceding provisions, each outstanding Class of Certificates or Component shall be entitled to receive its pro rata share of the amount of such excess, up to the amount of any unrecovered Realized Loss previously allocated to such Class or Component.
Any such recovery allocated to a Class of Certificates shall not further reduce the Certificate Principal Amount or Component Principal Amount of such Certificate.

In addition, the Trustee shall have no responsibility for any act or omission of the Master Servicer prior to the issuance of any notice of termination and shall have no liability relating to the representations and warranties of the Master Servicer set forth in Section 9.14.
In the Trustee’s capacity as such successor, the Trustee shall have the same limitations on liability herein granted to the Master Servicer.
As compensation therefor, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive all compensation payable to the Master Servicer under this Agreement, including the Master Servicing Fee.
(c)Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling to continue to so act, or shall, if it is unable to so act, appoint a successor Master Servicer or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established housing and home finance institution servicer, master servicer, servicing or mortgage servicing institution having a net worth of not less than $15,000,000 and meeting such other standards for a successor master servicer as are set forth in this Agreement, as the successor to such Master Servicer in the assumption of all of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of a master servicer, like the Master Servicer.

The Trustee and such successor shall take such actions, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession and may make other arrangements with respect to the servicing to be conducted hereunder which are not inconsistent herewith.
Neither the Trustee nor any other successor master servicer shall be deemed to be in default hereunder by reason of any failure to make, or any delay in making, any distribution hereunder or any portion thereof caused by (i) the failure of the Master Servicer to deliver, or any delay in delivering, cash, documents or records to it, (ii) the failure of the Master Servicer to cooperate as required by this Agreement, (iii) the failure of the Master Servicer to deliver the Mortgage Loan data to the Trustee as required by this Agreement or (iv) restrictions imposed by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Master Servicer.

Upon any such waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement.
No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.Section 6.17.

Action Upon Certain Failures of the Master Servicer and Upon Event of Default.
In the event that the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of any action or inaction of the Master Servicer that would become an Event of Default upon the Master Servicer’s failure to remedy the same after notice, the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the Master Servicer.
For all purposes of this Agreement, in the absence of actual knowledge by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any failure of the Master Servicer or any other Event of Default unless notified in writing by the Depositor, the Master Servicer or a Certificateholder.Section 6.20.

The Form 10-K shall include the certification required pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Form 10-K Certification”) signed by an appropriate party or parties designated by the Depositor (which Form 10-K Certification the Trustee shall not be required to sign).

(e)Each person (including their officers or directors) that signs any Form 10-K Certification shall be entitled to indemnification from the Trust Fund for any liability or expense incurred by it in connection with such certification, other than any liability or expense attributable to such Person’s own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct.

The total losses, regardless of whether claims are filed with the applicable insurer or surety, shall be disclosed in such reports together with the amount of such losses covered by insurance.

Power to Act; Procedures.
(a)The Master Servicer shall master service the Mortgage Loans and shall have full power and authority, subject to the REMIC Provisions and the provisions of Article X hereof, and each Servicer shall have full power and authority (to the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement) to do any and all things that it may deem necessary or desirable in connection with the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans, including but not limited to the power and authority (i) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Certificateholders and the Trustee, customary consents or waivers and other instruments and documents, (ii) to consent to transfers of any Mortgaged Property and assumptions of the Mortgage Notes and related Mortgages, (iii) to collect any Insurance Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, and (iv) to effectuate foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of the Mortgaged Property securing any Mortgage Loan, in each case, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and applicable Servicing Agreement, as applicable; provided that the Master Servicer shall not take, or knowingly permit any Servicer to take, any action that is inconsistent with or prejudices the interests of the Trust Fund or the Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan or the rights and interests of the Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificateholders under this Agreement.
The Master Servicer further is authorized and empowered by the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders and the Trustee, in its own name or in the name of any Servicer, when the Master Servicer or a Servicer, as the case may be, believes it is appropriate in its best judgment to register any Mortgage Loan with MERS, or cause the removal from the registration of any Mortgage Loan on the MERS system, to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee and the Certificateholders or any of them, any and all instruments of assignment and other comparable instruments with respect to such assignment or re-recording of a Mortgage in the name of MERS, solely as nominee for the Trustee and its successors and assigns.
The Master Servicer shall represent and protect the interests of the Trust Fund in the same manner as it protects its own interests in mortgage loans in its own portfolio in any claim, proceeding or litigation regarding a Mortgage Loan and shall not make or knowingly permit any Servicer to make any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan that would cause any REMIC formed hereby to fail to qualify as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax under Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Master Servicer in its own name or in the name of a Servicer, and each Servicer, to the extent such authority is delegated to such Servicer by the Master Servicer under the applicable Servicing Agreement, is hereby authorized and empowered by the Trustee when the Master Servicer or applicable Servicer, as the case may be, believes it appropriate in its best judgment and in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices and the applicable Servicing Agreement, to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself and the Certificateholders, the Trustee or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties.
If the Master Servicer or the Trustee has been advised that it is likely that the laws of the state in which action is to be taken prohibit such action if taken in the name of the Trustee or that the Trustee would be adversely affected under the “doing business” or tax laws of such state if such action is taken in its name, then upon request of the Trustee, the Master Servicer shall join with the Trustee in the appointment of a co-trustee pursuant to Section 6.09 hereof.
In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Master Servicer shall be an independent contractor and shall not, except in those instances where it is taking action in the name of the Trustee, be deemed to be the agent of the Trustee.
(b)In master servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer shall employ procedures and exercise the same care that it customarily employs and exercises in master servicing and administering loans for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with this Agreement.
Consistent with the foregoing, the Master Servicer may, and may permit any Servicer to, in its discretion (i) waive any late payment charge or any prepayment charge or penalty interest in connection with the prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend the due dates for payments due on a Mortgage Note for a period not greater than 120 days; provided, however, that the maturity of any Mortgage Loan shall not be extended past the date on which the final payment is due on the latest maturing Mortgage Loan as of the Cut-off Date.
In the event of any extension described in clause (ii) above, the Master Servicer shall make or cause to be made Advances on the related Mortgage Loan in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.04 on the basis of the amortization schedule of such Mortgage Loan without modification thereof by reason of such extension.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not, unless default by the related Mortgagor is, in the reasonable judgment of the Master Servicer or the related Servicer, reasonably foreseeable, make or knowingly permit such Servicer to make any modification, waiver or amendment of any material term of any Mortgage Loan (including but not limited to the interest rate, the principal balance, the amortization schedule, or any other term affecting the amount or timing of payments on the Mortgage Loan or the collateral therefor) unless the Master Servicer or the related Servicer shall have provided or caused to be provided to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking the modification) in writing to the effect that such modification, waiver or amendment would not be treated as giving rise to a new debt instrument for federal income tax purposes and would not adversely affect the status of any REMIC formed hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Master Servicer shall not without the Trustee’s written consent:  (i) initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee’s name without indicating the Master Servicer’s representative capacity or (ii) take any action with the intent to cause, and which actually does cause, the Trustee to be registered to do business in any state.Section 9.05.

Any fees, costs and expenses and other amounts payable to such Servicers shall be deducted from amounts remitted to the Master Servicer by the applicable Servicer (to the extent permitted by the applicable Servicing Agreement) and shall not be an obligation of the Trust, the Trustee or the Master Servicer.
(b)The Master Servicer shall not be required to (i) take any action with respect to the servicing of any Mortgage Loan that the related Servicer is not required to take under the related Servicing Agreement and (ii) cause a Servicer to take any action or refrain from taking any action if the related Servicing Agreement does not require the Servicer to take such action or refrain from taking such action; in both cases notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement that requires the Master Servicer to take such action or cause the Servicer to take such action.
(c)The Master Servicer, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders, shall enforce the obligations of each Servicer under the related Servicing Agreement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce the obligations of each Servicer under the related Servicing Agreement and shall, upon its obtaining actual knowledge of the failure of a Servicer to perform its obligations in accordance with the related Servicing Agreement, to the extent that the non-performance of any such obligations would have a material adverse effect on a Mortgage Loan, the Trust Fund or Certificateholders terminate the rights and obligations of such Servicer thereunder to the extent and in the manner permitted by the related Servicing Agreement and either act as servicer of the related Mortgage Loans or enter into a Servicing Agreement with a successor Servicer.
Such enforcement, including, without limitation, the legal prosecution of claims, termination of Servicing Agreements and the pursuit of other appropriate remedies, shall be in such form and carried out to such an extent and at such time as the Master Servicer, in its good faith business judgment, would require were it the owner of the related Mortgage Loans.
The Master Servicer shall pay the costs of such enforcement at its own expense, and shall be reimbursed therefor initially only (i) from a general recovery resulting from such enforcement only to the extent, if any, that such recovery exceeds all amounts due in respect of the related Mortgage Loans or (ii) from a specific recovery of costs, expenses or attorneys’ fees against the party against whom such enforcement is directed, and then, to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to reimburse the Master Servicer for the costs of such enforcement, (iii) from the Collection Account.Section 9.06.
Collection of Taxes, Assessments and Similar Items.
(a)To the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall cause each Servicer to establish and maintain one or more custodial accounts at a depository institution (which may be a depository institution with which the Master Servicer or any Servicer establishes accounts in the ordinary course of its servicing activities), the accounts of which are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the FDIC (each, an “Escrow Account”) and shall deposit therein any collections of amounts received with respect to amounts due for taxes, assessments, water rates, Standard Hazard Insurance Policy premiums or any comparable items for the account of the Mortgagors.
Withdrawals from any Escrow Account may be made (to the extent amounts have been escrowed for such purpose) only in accordance with the applicable Servicing Agreement.
Each Servicer shall be entitled to all investment income not required to be paid to Mortgagors on any Escrow Account maintained by such Servicer.
The Master Servicer shall make (or cause to be made) to the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement advances to the extent necessary in order to effect timely payment of taxes, water rates, assessments, Standard Hazard Insurance Policy premiums or comparable items in connection with the related Mortgage Loan (to the extent that the Mortgagor is required, but fails, to pay such items), provided that it has determined that the funds so advanced are recoverable from escrow payments, reimbursement pursuant to Section 4.02(v) or otherwise.
(b)Costs incurred by the Master Servicer or by Servicers in effecting the timely payment of taxes and assessments on the properties subject to the Mortgage Loans may be added to the amount owing under the related Mortgage Note where the terms of the Mortgage Note so permit; provided, however, that the addition of any such cost shall not be taken into account for purposes of calculating the distributions to be made to Certificateholders.
Such costs, to the extent that they are unanticipated, extraordinary costs, and not ordinary or routine costs shall be recoverable by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.02(v).Section 9.07.
Termination of Servicing Agreements; Successor Servicers.
(b)If the Master Servicer acts as Servicer, it will not assume liability for the representations and warranties of the Servicer, if any, that it replaces.
The Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to have the successor Servicer assume liability for the representations and warranties made by the terminated Servicer in respect of the related Mortgage Loans, and in the event of any such assumption by the successor Servicer, the Trustee or the Master Servicer, as applicable, may, in the exercise of its business judgment, release the terminated Servicer from liability for such representations and warranties.Section 9.08.
Master Servicer Liable for Enforcement.
Notwithstanding any Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Trustee and the Certificateholders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent of its obligations hereunder, without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of such Servicing Agreements or arrangements.
The Master Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Mortgage Loans are serviced in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of each Servicing Agreement for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
The Master Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with the Servicers for indemnification of the Master Servicer and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

(b)The Master Servicer or the related Servicer, as the case may be, shall be entitled to approve a request from a Mortgagor for the granting of an easement thereon in favor of another Person or any alteration or demolition of the related Mortgaged Property if it has determined, exercising its good faith business judgment in the same manner as it would if it were the owner of the related Mortgage Loan, that the security for, and the timely and full collectability of, such Mortgage Loan would not be materially adversely affected thereby.

Maintenance of the Primary Mortgage Insurance Policies.
(a)The Master Servicer shall not take, or knowingly permit any Servicer (consistent with the applicable Servicing Agreement) to take, any action that would result in non-coverage under any applicable Primary Mortgage Insurance Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of such Master Servicer or Servicer, would have been covered thereunder.

Alternatively, the Master Servicer may take, or authorize any Servicer to take, other actions in respect of a defaulted Mortgage Loan, which may include (i) accepting a short sale (a payoff of the Mortgage Loan for an amount less than the total amount contractually owed in order to facilitate a sale of the Mortgaged Property by the Mortgagor) or permitting a short refinancing (a payoff of the Mortgage Loan for an amount less than the total amount contractually owed in order to facilitate refinancing transactions by the Mortgagor not involving a sale of the Mortgaged Property), (ii) arranging for a repayment plan or (iii) agreeing to a modification in accordance with Section 9.04.

Compensation to the Master Servicer.

Neither the Trustee the Master Servicer nor the Holder of any Residual Certificate shall take any action within their respective control, cause any REMIC to take any action or fail to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action within its control and in the scope of its duties that, under the REMIC Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the status of any REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon any REMIC (including but not limited to the tax on prohibited transactions as defined in Code Section 860F(a)(2) and the tax on prohibited contributions set forth on Section 860G(d) of the Code) (either such event, an “Adverse REMIC Event”) unless the Trustee and the Master Servicer have received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action) to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger such status or result in the imposition of such a tax.
In addition, prior to taking any action with respect to any REMIC or the assets therein, or causing any REMIC to take any action, which is not expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement any Holder of a Residual Certificate will consult with the Trustee and the Master Servicer, or their respective designees, in writing, with respect to whether such action could cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur with respect to any REMIC, and no such Person shall take any such action or cause any REMIC to take any such action as to which the Trustee or the Master Servicer has advised it in writing that an Adverse REMIC Event could occur.
(g)Each Holder of a Residual Certificate shall pay when due any and all taxes imposed on the related REMIC by federal or state governmental authorities.
To the extent that such Trust taxes are not paid by a Residual Certificateholder, the Trustee shall pay any remaining REMIC taxes out of current or future amounts otherwise distributable to the Holder of the Residual Certificate in such REMIC or, if no such amounts are available, out of other amounts held in the Collection Account, and shall reduce amounts otherwise payable to holders of regular interests in such REMIC, as the case may be.
(h)The Trustee shall, for federal income tax purposes, maintain books and records with respect to each REMIC on a calendar year and on an accrual basis.
(i)No additional contributions of assets shall be made to any REMIC, except as expressly provided in this Agreement with respect to eligible substitute mortgage loans.

Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and Loss of REMIC Status.
In the event that a REMIC fails to qualify as a REMIC, loses its status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result of a prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC Provisions due to the negligent performance by the Trustee of its duties and obligations set forth herein, the Trustee shall indemnify the Holder of the Residual Certificate against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (“Losses”) resulting from such negligence; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be liable for any such Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Master Servicer, the Depositor, or the Holder of such Residual Certificate, as applicable, or for any such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by the Holder of such Residual Certificate on which the Trustee has relied.
The foregoing shall not be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Holder of such Residual Certificate now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no event shall the Trustee have any liability (1) for any action or omission that is taken in accordance with and in compliance with the express terms of, or which is expressly permitted by the terms of, this Agreement, (2) for any Losses other than arising out of a negligent performance by the Trustee its duties and obligations set forth herein, and (3) for any special or consequential damages to Certificateholders (in addition to payment of principal and interest on the Certificates).

(a)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee hereunder, shall not (except to the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement) permit any Servicer to, rent, lease, or otherwise earn income on behalf of any REMIC with respect to any REO Property which might cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as “foreclosure” property within the meaning of section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or result in the receipt by any REMIC of any “income from non-permitted assets” within the meaning of section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or any “net income from foreclosure property” which is subject to tax under the REMIC Provisions unless the Master Servicer has advised, or has caused the applicable Servicer to advise, the Trustee in writing to the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions, such action would not adversely affect the status of any REMIC as a REMIC and any income generated for any REMIC by the REO Property would not result in the imposition of a tax upon such REMIC.
(b)The Master Servicer shall make, or shall cause the applicable Servicer to make, reasonable efforts to sell any REO Property for its fair market value.
Binding Nature of Agreement; Assignment.

Any such amendment shall be deemed not to adversely affect in any material respect any Holder if the Trustee receives written confirmation from each Rating Agency that such amendment will not cause such Rating Agency to reduce, qualify or withdraw the then current rating assigned to the Certificates (and any Opinion of Counsel requested by the Trustee in connection with any such amendment may rely expressly on such confirmation as the basis therefor).
(b)This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66 2/3% of the Class Principal Amount (or Percentage Interest) of each Class of Certificates affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders; provided, however, that no such amendment shall be made unless the Trustee receives an Opinion of Counsel, at the expense of the party requesting the change, that such change will not adversely affect the status of any REMIC as a REMIC or cause a tax to be imposed on any REMIC; and provided further, that no such amendment may (i) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on Mortgage Loans which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holder of such Certificate or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentages of Class Principal Amount (or Percentage Interest) of Certificates of each Class, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment without the consent of the Holders of 100% of the Class Principal Amount (or Class Notional Amount) of each Class of Certificates affected thereby.
For purposes of this paragraph, references to “Holder” or “Holders” shall be deemed to include, in the case of any Class of Book-Entry Certificates, the related Certificate Owners.
(d)It shall not be necessary for the consent of Holders under this Section 11.03 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Holders shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.
(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Servicing Agreement, the Trustee shall not consent to any amendment of any Servicing Agreement except pursuant to the standards provided in this Section with respect to amendment of this Agreement.Section 11.04.

Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of a party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any occurrence be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any other occurrence.

We have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of our investment in the Privately Offered Certificates, and we and any account for which we are acting are each able to bear the economic risk of such investment.
(4)We are an Institutional Accredited Investor and we are acquiring the Privately Offered Certificates purchased by us for our own account or for one or more accounts (each of which is an Institutional Accredited Investor) as to each of which we exercise sole investment discretion.
(5)We have received such information as we deem necessary in order to make our investment decision.
(6)If we are acquiring ERISA-Restricted Certificates, we understand that in accordance with ERISA, the Code and the Exemption, no Plan and no person acting on behalf of such a Plan may acquire such Certificate except in accordance with Section 3.03(d) of the Trust Agreement.Terms used in this letter which are not otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Trust Agreement.
You and the Depositor are entitled to rely upon this letter and are irrevocably authorized to produce this letter or a copy hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.
