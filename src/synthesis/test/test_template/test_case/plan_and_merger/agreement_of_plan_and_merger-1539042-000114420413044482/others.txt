Provided that the Company is operating the Company Business in accordance with the Operating Plan and has performed and complied in all material respects with all of the Company’s obligations in this Agreement, including this ARTICLE 6, until the earlier of the (a) Effective Time and (b) the Outside Date, the Parent will provide or cause to be provided sufficient equity capital or other financing to the Company to permit the Company to satisfy (i) the Company’s obligations under this Section 6.1(c) (unless such compliance is waived by the Parent pursuant to this Section 6.1); and (ii) those obligations and liabilities incurred by the Company (A) after the Signing Date (to the extent permitted under Section 6.1(b) and this Section 6.1(c)); and (B) prior to the Signing Date but affirmed by the Parent pursuant to Section 6.1(b) or this Section 6.1(c).
For avoidance of doubt, any shares of Company Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to this Section 6.1(c) will not affect or be included in the Base Company Shares.
(vii)       The Company’s obligations under Section 6.1(a) and 6.1(b) are subject to this Section 6.1(c) (which will control to the extent that there is any conflict between Section 6.1(a) or 6.1(b) (or both) and this Section 6.1(c)).
(d)          For avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the Company’s obligations under Section 6.1(a) and 6.1(b), the terms of the Operating Plan and the provisions of Section 6.1(c), the business and affairs of the Company shall remain under the direction of the Company Board (or a designated Company Board Committee).
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1(b), in the event that the Company Board (or a designated Company Board Committee) determines that it is necessary in order to exercise and comply with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law and preserve the continued viability of the Company, then the Company is permitted to issue and sell shares of capital stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock) without the consent of the Parent.
In the event that any shares of capital stock of the Company are issued or issuable in reliance on this Section 6.1(d), and without the approval of the Parent contemplated by Section 6.1(c), then the number of shares of Company Common Stock included in the Base Company Shares will be increased by the number of the additional shares of capital stock of the Company so issued or issuable (on a fully-diluted basis).
Section 6.2           Acquisition Proposals.
(a)          Except as provided in this Section 6.2(a) and in Section 6.2(d), the Company shall not (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to not), and shall take such reasonable actions to cause (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to take such reasonable actions to cause) each Company Entity’s officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents, and other representatives (collectively, the “Representatives”) not to, (i) directly or indirectly initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries with respect to, or the making or submission of, any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information or data relating to any Company Entity or any Company Asset to, or provide access to the properties, books or records of any Company Entity to, any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal or in contemplation of an Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing sentence, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company and the Company’s Board are permitted to take any actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 6.2(a) with respect to a third party if (w) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from such third party (and such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2(a), whether by any Company Entity or any Representative (as if all Company Entities and Representatives were bound by this Section 6.2(a))), (x) the Company gives the Parent the notice required by Section 6.2(e), (y) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors, the Company’s Board determines in good faith that such proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Company’s Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to participate in such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such information or data to such third party is likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; except that (1) the Company shall not deliver any non-public information to such third party without first entering into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (any such confidentiality agreement with such third party, an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”) and (2) subject to applicable Law, the Company shall make available to the Parent any non-public information concerning any Company Entity that is made available to any other Person or group in connection with any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal that was not previously made available to the Parent, contemporaneously with the delivery of such information to (or as promptly as practicable after such information is delivered to) such Person.
Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 will prohibit the Company or the Company’s Board from taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law, including the Company Board’s fiduciary duties; except that compliance with such rules will not permit the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 6.2(d).
(d)          Notwithstanding the foregoing set forth in this Section 6.2, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to the Company’s compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 6.2 and Section 6.4(a), with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company’s Board is permitted to make an Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) a written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of Section 6.2(a), whether by any Company Entity or any Representative (as if all Company Entities and Representatives were bound by this Section 6.2(d))) is made to the Company by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company’s Board determines in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company’s Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change is likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iv) subject to compliance with applicable Law, the Company provides the Parent three Business Days’ prior written notice of the Company’s intention to make an Adverse Recommendation Change because of such Acquisition Proposal (such notice, a “Notice of Acquisition Proposal”), it being understood that a Notice of Acquisition Proposal does not in itself institute an Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes hereof, which notice must include the information with respect to such Acquisition Proposal that is specified in Section 6.2(e); except that, if there are any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal (relative to the terms of the Acquisition Proposal as set forth in the Notice of Acquisition Proposal as provided to the Parent), then the Company must provide to the Parent a new Notice of Acquisition Proposal and, if the Company has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change, and subject to compliance with applicable Law, an additional three Business Days following the provision of such new Notice of Acquisition Proposal, and (v) at the end of the three-Business Day period described in the immediately foregoing clause (iv) (including any extension of such period required thereunder), the Company Board again makes the determination in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms hereof that the Parent proposes) that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change is likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
If the Parent proposes to the Company any adjustment or modification of the terms hereof in response to a Notice of Acquisition Proposal, and such proposed adjustment or modification, if implemented, would reverse the determination of the Company Board that the Acquisition Proposal constituted a Superior Proposal, then the Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith with the Parent to implement such adjustment or modification to the terms hereof and, upon implementation of such adjustment or modification, the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change (or, if already made, will reinstate its recommendation in favor of the Merger and this Agreement, as so adjusted or modified).
The Company shall keep the Parent reasonably informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposals (including disclosing to the Parent the identity of the parties, the price involved, and any material changes to any terms thereof and providing to the Parent detailed, written summaries of all of the material terms, provisions, or other information set forth in any amended or additional documents received from or provided to any Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal).
The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party and shall use its reasonable efforts to enforce any such agreement at the request of or on behalf of the Parent.
(g)          Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit or restrict the Company’s Board from effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal in response to a material adverse development or change in circumstances with respect to the Parent Business occurring or arising after the Signing Date, if (i) the Company’s Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that not making such Adverse Recommendation Change is likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law (ii) subject to compliance with applicable Law, the Company provides the Parent three Business Days’ prior written notice of the Company’s intention to make public an Adverse Recommendation Change because of such material development or change in circumstances (such notice, a “Notice of Material Development”); and that it is considering such a recommendation change and summarizing in reasonable detail the reasons therefor; and (iii) at the end of the three-Business Day period described in the immediately foregoing clause (ii), the Company Board again makes the determination in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms hereof that the Parent proposes in writing) that failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change is likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
If the Parent proposes to the Company any adjustment or modification of the terms hereof in response to a Notice of Material Development, and such proposed adjustment or modification, if implemented, would reverse the determination of the Company Board that it make an Adverse Recommendation Change, then the Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith (during a period not exceeding three Business days, unless otherwise mutually agreed) with respect to such adjustment or modification to the terms hereof and, upon implementation of such adjustment or modification, the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change (or, if already made, will reinstate its recommendation in favor of the Merger and this Agreement, as so adjusted or modified).
Section 6.3           Access to Information and Properties.
Each Accessing Party shall not access and shall not review the foregoing information in a manner that interferes unreasonably with the operations of the Permitting Party or the Permitting Party’s Subsidiaries or that unreasonably interferes with the prompt discharge by the Permitting Party’s employees of their duties.
Representatives of the Accessing Party (including, in the case of Parent, the Parent Liaison Officer), when visiting the premises of the Permitting Party, will at all times conduct themselves in accordance with applicable local law and the reasonable policies and procedures of the Permitting Party.
(b)          Each of the Company and the Parent (as the case might be, the “Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Party and the other Party’s Subsidiaries (such other Party and such other Party’s Subsidiaries, collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from any and all Claims and Liabilities, including costs and expenses for the injury to or death of any of the Indemnified Party’s representatives and any loss or destruction of any property (including Claims or Liabilities for use of any property) resulting directly or indirectly from the action or inaction of any of the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnifying Party’s Subsidiaries, or their respective representatives, as applicable, during any visit to the business or property of the Indemnifying Party prior to the completion of the Merger (whether pursuant to Section 6.3(a) or otherwise), other than any such Claims and Liabilities arising out of or resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of the representatives of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnified Party’s Subsidiaries.
Each Indemnified Party is hereby made a third-party beneficiary of the rights that would be afforded under this Section 6.3(b) to such Indemnified Party as if such Indemnified Party were an original signatory hereto for such purposes (and only for such purposes).
(d)          A Party will not be required to provide access to or to disclose information (and will not be required to cause such Party’s Subsidiaries to provide access to or to disclose information) if such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of such Party’s customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, or contravene any Law or any binding Contract entered into prior to the Signing Date.
If such a circumstance arises, then the Company and the Parent shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.
(e)          During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall grant the Parent Liaison Officer full access to the Company headquarters’ offices, and any other real property that any Company Entity leases as the Parent Liaison Officer reasonably requests, and all Company books, records, and personnel during normal business hours, and shall permit the Parent to host authorized Parent representatives at the Company headquarters’ offices, including engineers, advisors and consultants, and lenders and financing sources, at the Parent’s sole risk and expense (subject to Section 6.3(b)) and without unreasonably disrupting Company operations, in order to investigate and assess the management of any Company Entity, as Parent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate (a “Parent Investigation”).
The Company shall (and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to) cooperate with the Parent in conducting any such Parent Investigation and, (ii) allow Parent full access to the Company Entities’ respective businesses, the Company Real Property, and the Company Assets.
(f)          The information obtained by any Party or such Party’s representatives pursuant to this Section 6.3 is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.3, the extent to which any such representative is entitled to Confidential Information is governed by the Confidentiality Agreement.
(g)          Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, (i) no Party is obligated under Section 6.3 to disclose to any other Party or such other Party’s representatives, or grant such other Party or such other Party’s representatives access to, information that is within the possession or control of such first Party or such first Party’s Subsidiaries but that is not permitted to be disclosed to such other Party or such other Party’s representative pursuant to a binding confidentiality agreement with a third party without first obtaining the consent of such third party, and such other Party, to the extent requested by such first Party, shall use such other Party’s Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain any such consent.
(h)          No investigation by any Party or such Party’s representatives will (or will be deemed to) modify or constitute a waiver of any of the terms hereof (including any representation, warranty, obligation, acknowledgment, or condition hereunder).
Section 6.4           Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.
(a)          Subject to the terms hereof, each Party shall use such Party’s Reasonable Best Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including using Reasonable Best Efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 7, to obtain, give, or make all necessary Consents, and to effect all necessary registrations and filings.
(b)          Subject to the terms hereof, each Party shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions can be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.
(c)          Subject to the terms hereof, each Party shall use such Party’s Reasonable Best Efforts to prevent the entry of, and to cause to be discharged, vacated, or terminated, any order, decree, ruling, or injunction precluding, restraining, enjoining, delaying, or prohibiting consummation of the Merger.
If any Governmental Entity issues any such order, decree, ruling, or injunction, or takes any other action that would have the effect of precluding, restraining, enjoining, delaying, or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, then, subject to the terms hereof, each Party shall use such Party’s Reasonable Best Efforts to have such order, decree, ruling, or injunction or other action declared ineffective as soon as practicable.
(e)          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4, no Buyer Entity is hereby required to divest or hold separate or in trust (or submit to the imposition of any other conditions or restriction with respect to) any assets or operations of such Buyer Entity or any of such Buyer Entity’s Affiliates or of any Company Entity.

Following any such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company is permitted to submit this Agreement to the Company Capital Stock Holders without a recommendation or with a negative recommendation, in which event the Company Board is permitted to communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative recommendation to the Company Capital Stock Holders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

d)          Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
The Corporation is not required to effect any conversion of the Series A Preference Shares, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of the Series A Preference Shares, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder’s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with such Holder or any of such Holder’s Affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preference Shares with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Series A Preference Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, the Series A Preference Shares or the Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates.

To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
A determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
For purposes of this Section 6.d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (x) the Corporation’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation or (z) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Series A Preference Shares, by such Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.
“Beneficial Ownership Limitation” means, subject to the next sentence, 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series A Preference Shares held by the applicable Holder.

The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner with the terms of this Section 6.d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) that may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.

In any case, the adjustments shall be described in a statement delivered to the Holders describing the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription rights applicable to one share of Common Stock.
Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above.

Any Forced Conversion Notices shall be applied ratably to all of the Holders based on each Holder’s ownership of Series A Preference Shares as of the Forced Conversion Date, provided that any voluntary conversions by a Holder shall be applied against such Holder’s pro rata allocation, thereby decreasing the aggregate amount forcibly converted hereunder if less than all shares of the Series A Preference Shares are forcibly converted.
For purposes of clarification, a Forced Conversion shall be subject to all of the provisions of Section 6, including, without limitation, the provisions requiring payment of liquidated damages and limitations on conversions.
In the event that a Forced Conversion is subject to limitation with respect to one or more Holders because of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation under Section 6.d), then the Series A Preference Shares held by such Holders will remain outstanding, but only to the extent and only for so long, as necessary to comply with such restrictions, and from and after the Forced Conversion Date, any and all such shares of Series A Preference Shares that remain outstanding shall no longer (a) bear further dividends pursuant to Section 3, (b) be subject to further adjustments pursuant to Sections 7.b), c) or d), or (c) require the Corporation to make payments in the event of any Triggering Event.

f)         Severability.
If any provision of these Series A Preference Terms is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of these Series A Preference Terms shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances.
If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law.

vii.
Closing of Books.
The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.
e)           Holder’s Exercise Limitations.
The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder’s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder’s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below).
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of Ordinary Shares which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Ordinary Shares Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith.
To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder’s determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding.
In any case, the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding Ordinary Shares was reported.
The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 9.99% of the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.
The Holder, upon not less than 61 days’ prior written notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of Ordinary Shares upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply.
The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.
The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.
Section 3.
Certain Adjustments.
a)          Stock Dividends and Splits.
If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on Ordinary Shares or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in Ordinary Shares (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Ordinary Shares issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding Ordinary Shares into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding Ordinary Shares into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of Ordinary Shares any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.
In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Ordinary Shares Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Ordinary Shares (the “Purchase Rights”), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of Ordinary Shares acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Ordinary Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such Ordinary Shares as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).
c)           Fundamental Transaction.
If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Ordinary Shares are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Ordinary Shares, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Ordinary Shares or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Ordinary Shares are effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares (not including any Ordinary Shares held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “Fundamental Transaction”), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of capital stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the “Alternate Consideration”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of Ordinary Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant).
For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one Ordinary Share in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.
If holders of Ordinary Shares are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction.
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein.
e)           Calculations.
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of Ordinary Shares deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.
i.
Adjustment to Exercise Price.

If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Ordinary Shares, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Ordinary Shares, (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Ordinary Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Ordinary Shares, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Ordinary Shares are converted into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Ordinary Shares of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Ordinary Shares of record shall be entitled to exchange their Ordinary Shares for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice.
The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.
Section 4.
Transfer of Warrant.

j)           Remedies.

d)             Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
The Corporation is not required to effect any conversion of the Series A Preference Shares, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of the Series A Preference Shares, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder’s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with such Holder or any of such Holder’s Affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.

To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
A determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
For purposes of this Section 6.d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (x) the Corporation’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation or (z) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.

For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Corporation provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 7.b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holders are entitled to receive a number of Conversion Shares based upon the Base Conversion Price on or after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether a Holder accurately refers to the Base Conversion Price in the Notice of Conversion.
vi.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.b) to the contrary, no adjustment will be made under this Section 7.b) in respect of any Exempt Issuance.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants.
d)           Pro Rata Distributions.
If the Corporation, at any time while the Series A Preference Shares are outstanding, distributes to all holders of Common Stock (and not to the Holders) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security (other than such distributions of rights, options or warrants to purchase Common Stock, which shall be subject to Section 7.c)), then in each such case the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the then fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness or rights, options or warrants so distributed applicable to one outstanding share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board in good faith.
In any case, the adjustments shall be described in a statement delivered to the Holders describing the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription rights applicable to one share of Common Stock.
Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above.
e)            Calculations.
All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 7, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding as of such date.

Adjustment to Conversion Price.

Notice to Allow Conversion by Holder.
The Holder shall remain entitled to convert such Holder’s Series A Preference Shares during the 10-day period commencing on the date of such notice through the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.
Section 8.
Forced Conversion.
Any Forced Conversion Notices shall be applied ratably to all of the Holders based on each Holder’s ownership of Series A Preference Shares as of the Forced Conversion Date, provided that any voluntary conversions by a Holder shall be applied against such Holder’s pro rata allocation, thereby decreasing the aggregate amount forcibly converted hereunder if less than all shares of the Series A Preference Shares are forcibly converted.
For purposes of clarification, a Forced Conversion shall be subject to all of the provisions of Section 6, including, without limitation, the provisions requiring payment of liquidated damages and limitations on conversions.
In the event that a Forced Conversion is subject to limitation with respect to one or more Holders because of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation under Section 6.d), then the Series A Preference Shares held by such Holders will remain outstanding, but only to the extent and only for so long, as necessary to comply with such restrictions, and from and after the Forced Conversion Date, any and all such shares of Series A Preference Shares that remain outstanding shall no longer (a) bear further dividends pursuant to Section 3, (b) be subject to further adjustments pursuant to Sections 7.b), c) or d), or (c) require the Corporation to make payments in the event of any Triggering Event.
Section 9.

Section 10.
Holder Redemption Upon Triggering Events.
a)          “Triggering Event” means, wherever used herein, any of the following events (whatever the reason for such event and whether such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court, or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): i.            the failure of the initial Conversion Shares Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 185th day after the Original Issue Date; provided that, so long as Rule 144 is then available to the Holders without restrictions or limitations on resale this Triggering Event shall be tolled until such time that Rule 144 is unavailable for the resale of the Conversion Shares; ii.
the Corporation shall fail to have available a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to issue to such Holder upon a conversion hereunder; vii.
the Common Stock shall fail to be (1) registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or (2) listed or quoted for trading on a Trading Market for more than (x) five consecutive Trading Days or (y) ten total Trading Days (which need not be consecutive Trading Days).
For purposes of this Section, a Series A Preference Share is outstanding until such date as the applicable Holder shall have received Conversion Shares upon a conversion (or attempted conversion) thereof that meets the requirements hereof or has been paid the Triggering Redemption Amount in cash.
Section 11.
Change of Control Transaction.

f)             Severability.
If any provision of these Series A Preference Terms is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of these Series A Preference Terms shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances.
If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law.
