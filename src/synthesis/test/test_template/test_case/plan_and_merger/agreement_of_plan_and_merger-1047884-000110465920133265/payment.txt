(i)            Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 6, a holder of any share or shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right, at its option, to convert all or any portion of such holder’s outstanding Series C Preferred Stock (the “Conversion Right”), subject to the conditions described below, into (i) an amount in cash equal to $[____]2 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the “Conversion Cash”) and (ii) the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock initially at a conversion rate of [____________]3 shares of Common Stock per $25.00 liquidation preference (the “Conversion Rate”), which is equivalent to an initial Conversion Price of approximately $[______]4 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 7).
(ii)           In connection with the conversion of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of any fractional interest in an amount equal to the fractional interest multiplied by the Closing Sale Price (as defined below) on a day during which trading in securities generally occurs on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Stock is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal other United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed (including the Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq Capital Market) or, if the Common Stock is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, on the principal other market on which the Common Stock is then traded (“Trading Day”) immediately prior to the Conversion Date (as defined below) or the Corporation Conversion Option Date (as defined below).
If more than one share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of those shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock so surrendered.

(v)           If a holder of Series C Preferred Stock has exercised its right to require the Corporation to repurchase shares of Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 13 hereof, such holder’s Conversion Rights with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock so subject to repurchase shall expire at 5:00PM, New York City time, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the repurchase date, unless the Corporation defaults on the payment of the purchase price.
(d)            Payment of Dividends.
However, at the time that such holder surrenders the Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, the holder shall pay to the Corporation an amount equal to the dividend that has accrued and that shall be paid on the related Dividend Payment Date.
(D)           A holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock on a Dividend Record Date who exercises its Conversion Right and converts such Series C Preferred Stock into Conversion Cash and Common Stock on or after the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such Series C Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date, and the converting holder need not include payment of the amount of such dividend upon surrender for conversion of Series C Preferred Stock.
(B)            If the Corporation exercises the Corporation Conversion Option and the Corporation Conversion Option Date is a date that is prior to the close of business on any Dividend Record Date, the holder shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the dividend payable for such period on such converted shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date.
  (i)            the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date and (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution; and (ii)           the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date.
  (c)            If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue rights or warrants for a period expiring within 60 days to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock), at a price per share of Common Stock (or having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share of Common Stock) less than the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the announcement by public notice of such issuance or distribution (treating the conversion, exchange or exercise price per share of Common Stock of the securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock as equal to (x) the sum of (i) the price for a unit of the security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion of or exchange or exercise for such security into Common Stock divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date after such date of announcement by a fraction: (i)            the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of announcement, and (y) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities; and (ii)           the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date of announcement, and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate exercise price or conversion price payable to exercise or convert such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities divided by the average of the daily Closing Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such date (subject to any adjustment as required pursuant to Section 7(g)) (“Current Market Price”) immediately preceding the date of announcement of the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.
(e)            If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock during any quarterly fiscal period, cash (including any quarterly cash dividends, but excluding any cash that is distributed upon a reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 8 applies or as part of a distribution referred to in Section 7(d)) which results in an annualized Common Stock dividend yield which is greater than 6.25% (the “Dividend Threshold Amount”), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: (i) CR1 = CRo +(($25.00 x (CSY — 6.25%)/4)/SP) where, (A)           CRo = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Record Date for such distribution; (B)            CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Record Date for such distribution; (C)            SP = the average of the Closing Sale price per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period prior to the Trading Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Record Date or the ex-dividend date of such cash excess dividend or cash excess distribution; and
  (D)            CSY = the annualized Common Stock dividend yield, calculated as all cash dividends and cash distributions paid to the Corporation’s holders of Common Stock during the fiscal quarter, multiplied by four, divided by SP.
(f)            (i) If any tender offer made by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of Common Stock shall expire, then, if the tender offer shall require the payment to the holders of Common Stock of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value that exceeds the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the “Expiration Date”) tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) (the last time at which such tenders could have been made on the Expiration Date is hereinafter sometimes called the “Expiration Time”), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date by a fraction: (A)           the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value of the aggregate consideration payable to holder of the Common Stock based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the “Purchased Shares”) and (y) the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares and excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Corporation) at the Expiration Time and (ii) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date; and (B)            the denominator of which shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including Purchased Shares but excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Corporation) at the Expiration Time multiplied by (y) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date.
(11)        Purchase of Series C Preferred Stock upon a Fundamental Change.
(a)            In the event of a fundamental change, a holder of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right to require the Corporation to purchase (the “Repurchase Right”) for cash all or any part of such holder’s shares of Series C Preferred Stock at a purchase price (the “Fundamental Change Repurchase Price”) equal to 100% of the liquidation preference of the Series C Preferred Stock to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid dividends (including additional dividends, if any) to, but not including, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined below).
Shares of Series C Preferred Stock submitted for purchase must be $25.00 liquidation preference or an integral multiple thereof.

(h)          The Corporation shall be required to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock no less than 30 days nor more than 45 days after the date of the Corporation’s delivery of Notice of the fundamental change, subject to extension to comply with applicable law (as set forth in the Notice of the fundamental change, the “Fundamental Change Repurchase Date”).
A holder of Series C Preferred Stock shall receive payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the Series C Preferred Stock.
(k)          The Corporation shall not be required to repurchase the Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change if a third party (1) makes an offer to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements applicable to the Corporation to repurchase Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change and (2) purchases all of the Series C Preferred Stock validly delivered and not withdrawn under such offer to purchase Series C Preferred Stock.
(b)          Whenever dividends on any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive) (a “Preferred Dividend Default”), the holders of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock, upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable), shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Corporation (the “Preferred Stock Directors”), and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall increase by two, at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at least 10% of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders of any other series of Parity Stock so in arrears (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment.
