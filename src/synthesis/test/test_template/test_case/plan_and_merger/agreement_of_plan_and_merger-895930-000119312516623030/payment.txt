(a) Subject to the rights of Holders of any class of capital stock ranking senior to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, Holders shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors and to the extent lawful, cumulative dividends at a rate per year of 5.250% of the Initial Liquidation Preference (equivalent to $5.25 per year per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock), payable in cash, by delivery of shares of Common Stock or by delivery of any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion (subject to the limitations described in Section 4).
Declared dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be payable quarterly on each Dividend Payment Date at such annual rate, and dividends shall accumulate from the most recent date as to which dividends shall have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid, from the Initial Issue Date, whether or not declared or in any Dividend Period or Dividend Periods, as the case may be, there have been funds or shares of Common Stock legally available for the payment of such dividends.
Dividends will be payable on a Dividend Payment Date to Holders that are Record Holders on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date, but only to the extent a dividend has been declared to be payable on such Dividend Payment Date, except that dividends payable on the Mandatory Conversion Date will be payable to the Holders 10
Dividends payable on shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock for each full Dividend Period shall be computed by dividing the annual dividend rate by four.
Dividends payable on shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock for any period other than a full Dividend Period shall be based on the number of days elapsed during such Dividend Period and computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Accumulated dividends on shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall not bear interest if they are paid subsequent to the applicable Dividend Payment Date.
Method of Payment of Dividends.
(b) Each payment of a declared dividend on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be made in cash, except to the extent the Corporation timely elects to make all or any portion of such payment in shares of Common Stock.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered, in connection with any declared dividend on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, including any dividend payable in connection with a conversion, exceed a number equal to the total dividend payment divided by $15.75, subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportional to any adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 11 (such dollar amount, as adjusted from time to time, the “Floor Price”).
To the extent that the amount of any declared dividend exceeds the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with such declared dividend and (y) 97% of the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if it is legally able to do so, notwithstanding any notice by the Corporation to the contrary, pay such excess amount in cash.
(f) In respect of any cash paid, shares of Common Stock issued or Units of Exchange Property delivered in payment or partial payment of a dividend to a Non-U.S. Holder, the Corporation shall withhold and, in the case of such shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property, the Corporation may do so by selling (or directing the Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf of the Corporation to withhold and sell) such amount in cash, number of shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property as the Corporation deems necessary, to result in proceeds from such sale (after deduction of customary commissions, which shall be for the account of such Non-U.S. Holder) to pay all or any part of any U.S. withholding tax obligation that the Corporation has (as determined by it in its sole discretion) in respect of the payment or partial payment of such dividend of cash, shares of Common Stock or Units of Exchange Property to such Non-U.S. Holder.Section 5.
to the amount of accumulated dividends that have not been declared (the “Additional Conversion Amount”) divided by the greater of the Floor Price and 97% of the Average Price.
To the extent that the Additional Conversion Amount exceeds the product of such number of additional shares of Common Stock and 97% of the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if the Corporation is legally able to do so, declare and pay such excess amount in cash pro rata to the Holders.Section 6.
(a) Holders shall have the right to convert their shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one share Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any conversion pursuant to this Section 6, an “Optional Conversion”), at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, other than during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, into shares of Common Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.
(b) If as of any Optional Conversion Date the Corporation has not declared all or any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends for all full Dividend Periods ending on a Dividend Payment Date prior to such Optional Conversion Date, the Minimum Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, with respect to the relevant Optional Conversion, so that the converting Holder receives an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends that have not been declared for such full Dividend Periods (the “Optional Conversion Additional Conversion Amount”), divided by the greater of the Floor Price and the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the 22nd Trading Day prior to the Optional Conversion Date (such average being referred to as the “Optional Conversion Average Price”).
Except as described in the first sentence of this Section 6(b), upon any Optional Conversion of any shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for undeclared dividends on such shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, unless such Optional Conversion occurs after the Record Date for a declared dividend and on or prior to the immediately succeeding Dividend Payment Date, in which case the Corporation shall pay such dividend on such Dividend Payment Date to the Record Holder of the converted shares as of such Record Date, in accordance with Section 3.
(a) If a Fundamental Change occurs on or prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, Holders, subject to adjustments in accordance with Section 11, shall have the right to:(i) convert their Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any such conversion pursuant to this Section 7 being a “Fundamental Change Conversion”) at any time during the period (the “Fundamental Change Conversion Period”) from and including the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change to, but excluding, the earlier of (i) the Mandatory Conversion Date and (ii) the date that is 30 calendar days after the Effective Date (any conversion pursuant to this Section 7, a “Fundamental Change Conversion”) (1) into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock; or (2) if the Fundamental Change also constitutes a Reorganization Event, Units of Exchange Property in accordance with Section 11(e), based on the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate;(ii) with respect to such converted shares, receive a Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock; and(iii) with respect to such converted shares, receive the Accumulated Dividend Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock;subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Corporation’s right to deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu of all or part of such amounts as set forth in Section 7(d).

accumulated and unpaid dividends for all dividend periods ending on or prior to the Dividend Payment Date preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change as well as dividends accumulated to the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the “Accumulated Dividend Amount”), Holders who convert Series A-1 Preferred Stock within the Fundamental Change Conversion Period will be entitled to receive such Accumulated Dividend Amount upon conversion.
The Accumulated Dividend Amount will be payable at the Corporation’s election in either:(A) cash, to the extent the Corporation is legally permitted to do so,(B) an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to (x) the Accumulated Dividend Amount divided by (y) the greater of the Floor Price and 97% of the Stock Price, or(C) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.
(iii) The Corporation shall pay the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount and the Accumulated Dividend Amount in cash, except to the extent the Corporation elects on or prior to the second Business Day following the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change to make all or any portion of such payments in shares of Common Stock.
If the Corporation elects to deliver shares of Common Stock in respect of all or any portion of the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or Accumulated Dividend Amount, to the extent that the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or the Accumulated Dividend Amount or any portion thereof paid in shares of Common Stock exceeds the product of the number of additional shares the Corporation delivers in respect thereof and 97% of the Stock Price, the Corporation shall, if it is legally able to do so, declare and pay such excess amount in cash.
(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock or any other common stock or ADRs included in the Exchange Property otherwise issuable upon Mandatory Conversion, Optional Conversion or Fundamental Change Conversion (including in connection with a dividend payment), that Holder shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) based on the VWAP per share of Common Stock, or, if applicable, such other common stock or ADR, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date.
If the Corporation pays dividends in Common Stock, other common stock or ADRs pursuant to Section 4(b) on more than one share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock held at any one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock, or, if applicable, other common stock or full ADRs, payable in connection with such dividend shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion.Section 11.
(ii) If the Corporation issues to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock any rights (other than pursuant to any stockholder rights plan), options or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Record Date;X = the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; andY = the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, divided by the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance.Any increase in the Fixed Conversion Rates made pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such issuance.

(iv) If the Corporation pays a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula: CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution;CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution;SP0 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such distribution; andC = an amount of cash per share of Common Stock that the Corporation distributes to holders of the Common Stock.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “C” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iv)) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined in this Section 11(a)(iv)), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive, in respect of each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such distribution.
(v) If the Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries purchases Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (except as provided in Section 11(c)(iii)) and the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the “Expiration Date”), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) as of the Expiration Date of the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for shares of the Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date (the “Purchased Shares”);OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last time tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the “Expiration Time”), less any Purchased Shares;OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Time, including any Purchased Shares; andSP1 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date.The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under this Section 11(a)(v) shall occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth consecutive Trading Day immediately following, 28

To the extent that the amount of any declared dividend exceeds the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with such declared dividend and (y) 97% of the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if it is legally able to do so, notwithstanding any notice by the Corporation to the contrary, pay such excess amount in cash.

(a) Holders shall have the right to convert their shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one share Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any conversion pursuant to this Section 6, an “Optional Conversion”), at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, other than during the Fundamental Change Conversion Period, into shares of Common Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.
(b) If as of any Optional Conversion Date the Corporation has not declared all or any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends for all full Dividend Periods ending on a Dividend Payment Date prior to such Optional Conversion Date, the Minimum Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, with respect to the relevant Optional Conversion, so that the converting Holder receives an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends that have not been declared for such full Dividend Periods (the “Optional Conversion Additional Conversion Amount”), divided by the greater of the Floor Price and the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the 22nd Trading Day prior to the Optional Conversion Date (such average being referred to as the “Optional Conversion Average Price”).
Except as described in the first sentence of this Section 6(b), upon any Optional Conversion of any shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for undeclared dividends on such shares of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, unless such Optional Conversion occurs after the Record Date for a declared dividend and on or prior to the immediately succeeding Dividend Payment Date, in which case the Corporation shall pay such dividend on such Dividend Payment Date to the Record Holder of the converted shares as of such Record Date, in accordance with Section 3.
(a) If a Fundamental Change occurs on or prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, Holders, subject to adjustments in accordance with Section 11, shall have the right to:(i) convert their Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (any such conversion pursuant to this Section 7 being a “Fundamental Change Conversion”) at any time during the period (the “Fundamental Change Conversion Period”) from and including the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change to, but excluding, the earlier of (i) the Mandatory Conversion Date and (ii) the date that is 30 calendar days after the Effective Date (any conversion pursuant to this Section 7, a “Fundamental Change Conversion”) (1) into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate per share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock; or (2) if the Fundamental Change also constitutes a Reorganization Event, Units of Exchange Property in accordance with Section 11(e), based on the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate;(ii) with respect to such converted shares, receive a Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock; and(iii) with respect to such converted shares, receive the Accumulated Dividend Amount payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock;subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Corporation’s right to deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu of all or part of such amounts as set forth in Section 7(d).

(iii) The Corporation shall pay the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount and the Accumulated Dividend Amount in cash, except to the extent the Corporation elects on or prior to the second Business Day following the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change to make all or any portion of such payments in shares of Common Stock.
If the Corporation elects to deliver shares of Common Stock in respect of all or any portion of the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or Accumulated Dividend Amount, to the extent that the Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount or the Accumulated Dividend Amount or any portion thereof paid in shares of Common Stock exceeds the product of the number of additional shares the Corporation delivers in respect thereof and 97% of the Stock Price, the Corporation shall, if it is legally able to do so, declare and pay such excess amount in cash.
(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock or any other common stock or ADRs included in the Exchange Property otherwise issuable upon Mandatory Conversion, Optional Conversion or Fundamental Change Conversion (including in connection with a dividend payment), that Holder shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) based on the VWAP per share of Common Stock, or, if applicable, such other common stock or ADR, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date.
If the Corporation pays dividends in Common Stock, other common stock or ADRs pursuant to Section 4(b) on more than one share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock held at any one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock, or, if applicable, other common stock or full ADRs, payable in connection with such dividend shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion.Section 11.
(ii) If the Corporation issues to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock any rights (other than pursuant to any stockholder rights plan), options or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:

(v) If the Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries purchases Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer (except as provided in Section 11(c)(iii)) and the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the “Expiration Date”), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,CR0 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;CR1 = the Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date;FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) as of the Expiration Date of the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for shares of the Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date (the “Purchased Shares”);OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last time tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the “Expiration Time”), less any Purchased Shares;OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Time, including any Purchased Shares; andSP1 = the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date.The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under this Section 11(a)(v) shall occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth consecutive Trading Day immediately following, 28
