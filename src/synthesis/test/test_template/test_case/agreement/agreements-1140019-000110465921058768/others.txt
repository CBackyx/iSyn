Indemnification Procedure
(a)                                 Any person obligated to provide indemnification under this Article VI (“Indemnifying Party” for the purpose of this Section 6.4) shall not be liable under the indemnification provisions of this Article VI with respect to any claim made against a party entitled to indemnification under this Article VI (“Indemnified Party” for the purpose of this Section 6.4) unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the Indemnifying Party in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such Indemnified Party (or after such party shall have received notice of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the Indemnifying Party of any such claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on account of the indemnification provision of this Article VI.
In case any such action is brought against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense thereof.
The Indemnifying Party also shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action.
After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party’s election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such party under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless:
(i)                                     the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or
(ii)                                  the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.
A successor by law of the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnification contained in this Article VI.
The indemnification provisions contained in this Article VI shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
ARTICLE VII.

(b)                                 Fund and/or Underwriter shall remain obligated to pay Company the fee in effect as of the date of termination for so long as shares are held by the Accounts and Company continues to provide services to the Accounts.
Such fee shall apply to shares purchased both prior to and subsequent to the date of termination.
(c)                                  In the event of the insolvency or liquidation of the Company, fees shall continue to be payable directly to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor, without diminution and reasonable provision for verification by the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.
