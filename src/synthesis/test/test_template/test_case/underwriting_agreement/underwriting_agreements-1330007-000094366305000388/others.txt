                    (viii)      There is no action, suit or proceeding against the Company pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, before any court, arbitrator, administrative agency or other tribunal (i) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or the Underwritten Certificates, (ii) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Underwritten Certificates or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) that might materially and adversely affect the performance by the Company of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or the Underwritten Certificates or (iv) seeking to affect adversely the federal income tax attributes of the Underwritten Certificates as described in the Prospectus.

                    (x)         No authorization, approval or consent of any court or governmental authority or agency is necessary in connection with the offering or sale of the Underwritten Certificates pursuant to this Agreement, except such as have been, or as of the Closing Date will have been, obtained or such as may otherwise be required under applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and offer and sale of the Underwritten Certificates by the Underwriters and any recordation of the respective assignments of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that have not been completed.
                    (xi)        The Company possesses all material licenses, certificates, authorities or permits issued by the appropriate state, federal or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business now operated by it, and the Company has not received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such license, certificate, authority or permit which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would materially and adversely affect the condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company.

                    (xiii)      Neither the Company nor the Trust Fund is, and neither the sale of the Underwritten Certificates in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus nor the activities of the Trust Fund pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will cause the Company or the Trust Fund to be, an “investment company” or under the control of an “investment company” as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).
-5-
                    (xiv)      Under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and for federal income tax purposes, the Company reported the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee in exchange for the Certificates and will report the sale of the Underwritten Certificates to the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement as a sale of the interests in the Mortgage Loans evidenced by the Underwritten Certificates.
The consideration received by the Company upon the sale of the Underwritten Certificates to the Underwriters will constitute reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for the Underwritten Certificates.
The Company will be solvent at all relevant times prior to, and will not be rendered insolvent by, the sale of the Underwritten Certificates to the Underwriters.
In addition, the Company was solvent at all relevant times prior to, and was not rendered insolvent by, the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust Fund.

                    (iii)        The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Wachovia and Wachovia’s performance and compliance with the terms of this Agreement will not (A) violate Wachovia’s articles of association or by laws, (B) violate any law or regulation or any administrative decree or order to which it is subject or (C) constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any contract, agreement or other instrument to which Wachovia is a party or by which Wachovia is bound.
-6-
                    (iv)        Wachovia is not in default with respect to any order or decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency or body, which default might have consequences that would materially and adversely affect the condition (financial or other) or operations of Wachovia or its properties or have consequences that would materially and adversely affect its performance hereunder.
                    (v)        Wachovia is not a party to or bound by any agreement or instrument or subject to any articles of association, bylaws or any other corporate restriction or any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, law or regulation that would materially and adversely affect the ability of Wachovia to perform its obligations under this Agreement or that requires the consent of any third person to the execution of this Agreement or the performance by Wachovia of its obligations under this Agreement (except to the extent such consent has been obtained).
                    (vi)        No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by Wachovia of or compliance by Wachovia with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as have previously been obtained.
                    (vii)       No litigation is pending or, to the best of Wachovia’s knowledge, threatened against Wachovia that would assert the invalidity of this Agreement, prohibit its entering into this Agreement or materially and adversely affect the performance by Wachovia of its obligations under this Agreement.

                    (vii)       As described in the Prospectus Supplement and assuming compliance with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, REMIC I and REMIC II will each qualify as a REMIC within the meaning of Sections 860A through 860G (the “REMIC Provisions”) of the Code.
The portion of the Trust Fund consisting of the Additional Interest (as such terms are defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes under subpart E, Part I of subchapter J of the Code and the portion of the Trust Fund consisting of the Class A-FL Regular Interest, the Swap Agreement and the Floating Rate Account will be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes under subpart E, Part I of subchapter J of the Code;
                    (viii)      The Pooling and Servicing Agreement is not required to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the Trust Fund created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is not required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
-15-
                    (ix)        The Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement constitute the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, liquidation, receivership, moratorium, reorganization and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except that:  (a) provisions purporting to waive or limit rights to trial by jury, oral amendments to written agreements or rights of set off, (b) provisions relating to submission to jurisdiction, venue or service of process, (c) interest on interest provisions or (d) severability clauses may be limited by applicable law or considerations of public policy;
                    (x)         The Registration Statement is effective under the 1933 Act and, to such counsel’s knowledge, no stop order with respect thereto has been issued by the Commission;
                    (xi)        The Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of the date thereof (in each case, with the exception of any information incorporated by reference therein and any numerical, financial, statistical and quantitative data included therein), appeared on their respective faces to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such documents as of the relevant date;
                    (xii)       The statements contained in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading “Description of the Certificates”, insofar as such statements purport to summarize material terms of the Certificates, are correct in all material respects; and
                    (xiii)      The Certificates, when duly and validly executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and paid for in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement will be validly issued and outstanding and entitled to the benefits provided by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
                    Such opinions may express their reliance as to factual matters on the representations and warranties made by, and on certificates or other documents furnished by officers and/or authorized representatives of, the parties to this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and on certificates furnished by public officials.
Such opinion may assume the due authorization, execution and delivery of the instruments and documents referred to therein by the parties thereto.
Such opinion may be qualified as an opinion only on the laws of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States.
                    In a separate letter addressed only to the Underwriters, Dechert LLP shall additionally state that, based on conferences and telephone conversations with representatives of Wachovia, the Underwriters, the Company, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and their respective counsel, and (with limited exception) without having reviewed any of the mortgage notes, mortgages or other documents relating to the Mortgage Loans or made any inquiry of any originator of any Mortgage Loan, nothing has come to such counsel’s attention that would lead it to believe that (i) the Prospectus (other than any financial, numerical, statistical or quantitative information included therein), at the date of the Prospectus Supplement or at the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to
-16-
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) the Registration Statement (other than with respect to any exhibits filed therewith or any information incorporated by reference), at its effective date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
                    (i)          Wachovia is a national banking association validly existing under the laws of the United States of America and has the corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.
                    (ii)         This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Wachovia.
                    (iii)        No consent, approval, authorization or order of any state or federal court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation by Wachovia of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except for those consents, approvals, authorizations or orders that previously have been obtained, as may be required under federal or state securities laws, and such real estate filings as may be required in connection with the transfer of the Mortgage Loans and the other matters contemplated under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.
                    (iv)        The fulfillment of the terms of this Agreement will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any term or provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which with the passing of time or notification, or both, would constitute a default) under, the articles of association or by laws of Wachovia or, to such counsel’s knowledge, any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which Wachovia is a party or by which it is bound, or to such counsel’s knowledge, any order of any federal court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over Wachovia.
                    (v)        To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no actions, proceedings or investigations pending before or threatened by any court, administrative agency or other tribunal to which Wachovia is a party or of which any of its properties is the subject (a) which, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of Wachovia, (b) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement, (c) seeking to prevent the consummation by Wachovia of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (d) which, if adversely determined, might materially and adversely affect the performance by Wachovia of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.
-17-
                    (i)       they have performed certain specified procedures as a result of which they have determined that the information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and Prospectus Supplement under the captions “Summary of Prospectus Supplement,” “Description of the Mortgage Pool” and “Yield and Maturity Considerations” and on Annex A and in the Term Sheet agrees with the Master Tape prepared by or on behalf of the Mortgage Loan Seller, unless non material deviations are otherwise noted in such letter; and
                    (i)          they have compared the data contained in the Master Tape referred to in the immediately preceding clause (i) to information contained in an agreed upon sampling of the Mortgage Loan files and in such other sources as shall be specified by them, and found such data and information to be in agreement in all material respects, unless non material deviations are otherwise noted in such letter.
-18-
                    (r)      All proceedings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all documents incident hereto shall be satisfactory in form and substance to you and counsel for the Underwriters, and you and such counsel shall have received such additional information, certificates and documents as you or they may have reasonably requested.
                    If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, if the Company is in breach of any covenants or agreements contained herein or if any of the opinions and certificates referred to above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to you and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by you.
                    7.
Reimbursement of Underwriters’ Expenses.
If the sale of the Underwritten Certificates provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company and Wachovia, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Underwriters severally, upon demand, for all out of pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Underwritten Certificates.
-19-
                    8.
Indemnification.
                    (a)      The Company and Wachovia, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act and Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
                    (i)          against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus Supplement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided the foregoing indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting claims giving rise to any such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities purchased Underwritten Certificates if such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or Prospectus is eliminated or remedied in the Prospectus or a corrected and amended Prospectus as applicable, and, if required by law, a copy of the Prospectus (as corrected or amended, if applicable) shall not have been sent to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Underwritten Certificates to such person unless such failure to deliver the Prospectus (as corrected or amended, if applicable) was a result of the Company’s failure to furnish copies thereof in sufficient quantity or the Company’s failure to deliver copies thereof in such reasonable time period that would have allowed the Underwriter to provide the Prospectus (as corrected or amended, if applicable) to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Certificates to such person; provided, however, that the indemnity provided by this Section 8(a) shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or omission with respect to information with respect to which the Mortgage Loan Seller provides indemnification pursuant to Section 7 of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (the “Mortgage Loan Seller Covered Information”); provided, further, that, the indemnification provided by this Section 8 shall not apply to the extent that such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was made as a result of an error in the manipulation of, or in any calculations based upon, or in any aggregation of the information regarding the Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgagors and/or the related Mortgaged Properties set forth in the Master Tape or Annex A to the Prospectus Supplement or Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, to the extent (i) such information was materially incorrect in the Master Tape or such Annex A, as applicable, including without limitation the aggregation of such information relating to the Mortgage Loans in the Trust Fund or the information provided by the Mortgage Loan Seller, and (ii) such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense would be subject to the provisions of Section 7 of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement;
-20-
                    (ii)         against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company or as otherwise contemplated by Section 8(c); and
                    (iii)        against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Underwriter), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that the indemnity provided by this Section 8(a) shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information (as specified in Section 8(b) below) furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus Supplement (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
                    (b)      Each Underwriter, severally but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus Supplement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or in the Base Prospectus, such Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus Supplement (or any amendment or supplement thereto); provided, that no such material misstatement or omission arises from an error or omission in information relating to the underlying data regarding the Mortgage Loans or the related Mortgagors or Mortgaged Properties provided by the Company or the Mortgage Loan Seller to such Underwriter.
In addition, each Underwriter, severally but not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all losses, liabilities, claims and damages as incurred arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact contained in any Term Sheets or Computational Materials which, when read together with any Preliminary
-21-
Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), was required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, that no such material misstatement or omission arises from an error or omission in information relating to the underlying data regarding the Mortgage Loans or the related Mortgagors or Mortgaged Properties provided by the Company or the Mortgage Loan Seller to such Underwriter; and provided, further, that any such Term Sheets or Computational Materials were prepared and distributed by such Underwriter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnity in the immediately preceding sentence will apply only if such misstatement or omission was not also a misstatement or omission in the Prospectus.
It is hereby acknowledged that (i) the statements set forth in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth sentences of the penultimate paragraph on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, (ii) the statements in the second paragraph and the first sentence of the sixth paragraph under the caption “Method of Distribution” in the Prospectus Supplement, and (iii) the statements in any Computational Materials and Term Sheets prepared and delivered by the Underwriters to the Company for filing (subject to the other provisions of this Section (b)) with the Commission pursuant to this Agreement and the No Action Letters, constitute the only written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or in the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus Supplement (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
                    (c)      Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability under Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) hereof (unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced  by such failure) or any liability that it may have, otherwise than on account of the indemnity provided by this Section 8.
An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.
In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel, or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have assumed the defense of such action, with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, within a reasonable period following the indemnifying party’s receiving notice of such action, or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.
In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (or, in the event the Company or Wachovia is the indemnifying party, one counsel for each Underwriter) (in addition to any local counsel) separate from its or their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
Unless it shall assume the defense of any proceeding, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss
-22-
or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel or any other expenses for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this subsection, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of any proceeding, it shall be entitled to settle such proceeding with the consent of the indemnified party or, if such settlement provides for an unconditional release of the indemnified party in connection with all matters relating to the proceeding that have been asserted against the indemnified party in such proceeding by the other parties to such settlement, which release does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party without the consent of the indemnified party.
                    (d)      The indemnity provided by this Section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by the Company, the Underwriters, any of their respective directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company or the Underwriters, and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Underwritten Certificates.
                    (e)      Each Underwriter, severally but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless any other Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (collectively, the “Non Indemnifying Underwriter”) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, that arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact contained in Computational Materials or Term Sheets (other than the Computational Materials and Term Sheets attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B) which, when read together with any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement, was required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading prepared by such indemnifying Underwriter or any member of its selling group, in connection with the Underwritten Certificates (or in any revision or amendment thereof or supplement thereto); (ii) the failure of such indemnifying Underwriter, or any member of its selling group, to comply with any provision of Section 4(b) hereof, or (iii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact relating to the information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter for which such Underwriter is required to indemnify the Company under Section 8(b) above, and agrees to reimburse each such Non Indemnifying Underwriter, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense; provided, that the indemnity provided by this Section 8(e) shall not apply to the extent that such indemnified Underwriter is entitled under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to seek indemnity for such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense from the Mortgage Loan Seller.
                    The indemnity provided by this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter, the Company or Wachovia may otherwise have.
-23-
                    9.
Contribution.
                    (a)      In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity provided by Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, or if such indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is insufficient in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims or damages referred to therein, the Company and Wachovia, jointly and severally, and the Underwriters, severally, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by the indemnity provided by Section 8 incurred by the Company and the Underwriters, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and Wachovia on the one hand and each Underwriter on the other from the offering of the Underwritten Certificates or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and Wachovia on the one hand and of each Underwriter on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations (taking into account the parties’ relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission or failure to comply, and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances).
The relative benefits received by the Company and Wachovia on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective portions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Underwritten Certificates and the total underwriting discounts and commissions and other fees received by the Underwriters in connection therewith bear to the aggregate offering price of the Underwritten Certificates.
The relative fault of the Company and Wachovia on the one hand and of each Underwriter on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and Wachovia or by the Underwriters, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and no Underwriter shall be obligated to contribute more than its share of underwriting discounts and commissions and other fees pertaining to the Underwritten Certificates less any damages otherwise paid by such Underwriter with respect to such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense.
It is hereby acknowledged that the respective Underwriters’ obligations under this Section 9 shall be several and not joint.
For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, and such Underwriter’s officers and directors, shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
-24-
                     (b)      The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the considerations referred to in subsection (a) above.
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, liabilities, claims or damages referred to in Section 8 or this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal fees and disbursements or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such claim except where the indemnified party is required to bear such expenses, which expenses the indemnifying party shall pay as and when incurred, at the request of the indemnified party, to the extent that it is reasonable to believe that the indemnifying party will be ultimately obligated to pay such expenses.
In the event that any expenses so paid by the indemnifying party are subsequently determined to not be required to be borne by the indemnifying party hereunder, the party which received such payment shall promptly refund the amount so paid to the party which made such payment.
The remedies provided for in Section 8 and this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
                    (c)      The contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by the Company, the Underwriters, any of their respective directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company or the Underwriters, and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Underwritten Certificates.
                    10.
Default by an Underwriter.
In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date for the Underwritten Certificates shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding ten business days, as you shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
-25-
                    11.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company and Wachovia submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company and Wachovia, or by or on behalf of any of the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Sections 8 and 9, and shall survive delivery of the Underwritten Certificates to the Underwriters.
                    12.
Termination of Agreement; Survival.
                    (c)      The provisions of Section 5(e) regarding the payment of costs and expenses and the provisions of Sections 8 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement, whether such termination is pursuant to this Section 12 or otherwise.
                    13.
-26-
                    14.
Parties.
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each of the Underwriters, the Company and Wachovia and their respective successors.
Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the Underwriters, the Company and Wachovia and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Sections 8 and 9 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained.
This Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Underwriters, the Company and Wachovia and their respective successors, and said controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation.
No purchaser of Underwritten Certificates from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.
                    15.
Applicable Law; Counterparts.
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely in said State.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original and all of which shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
