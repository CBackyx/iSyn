The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 9(k), except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a "Conversion Date"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by facsimile or electronic mail (or otherwise deliver), for delivery on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "Conversion Notice") to the Company and (B) if required by Section 3(c)(iii), but without delaying the Company's requirement to deliver shares of Common Stock on the applicable Share Delivery Date (as defined below), surrender this Note to a common carrier for delivery to the Company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this Note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction).
The Holder may also indicate in a Conversion Notice the number of shares of Common Stock it seeks to receive upon conversion of any portion of this Note and the reduction of the Conversion Amount pursuant to such conversion shall be determined at the end of such Conversion Date by multiplying such number of shares of Common Stock by the applicable Conversion Price.
On or before the first (1st) Business Day following the date of delivery of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile or electronic mail a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to the Holder and the Company's transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent").
On or before the earlier of (i) the third (3rd) Trading Day and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period, in each case, following the date of delivery of a Conversion Notice (a "Share Delivery Date"), the Company shall (x) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian system or (y) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled.
If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion as required by Section 3(c)(iii) and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after delivery of this Note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 19(d)) representing the outstanding Principal not converted.
The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date, if such day is a Business Day, and if not, then on the next Business Day, irrespective of the date such shares of Common Stock are credited to the Holder's account with DTC or the date of delivery of the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock, as the case may be.
3 Insert the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for the five trading days immediately prior to signing definitive documents.
If the Company shall fail on or prior to the applicable Share Delivery Date to issue and deliver a certificate to the Holder, if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, or credit the Holder's balance account with DTC, if the Transfer Agent is participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (a "Conversion Failure"), and if on or after such Trading Day on which the certificate was to have been delivered to the Holder or the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled were to have been deposited in its account the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion that the Holder anticipated receiving from the Company (a "Buy-In"), then the Company shall, within three (3) Trading Days after the Holder's request promptly honor its obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit the Holder's balance account with DTC for such shares of Common Stock and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out of pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (the “Buy-In Price”) over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock, times (B) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed..
Nothing herein shall limit the Holder's right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company's failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof.
 (iii)        Registration; Book-Entry.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(c)(iii), the Holder may assign any Note or any portion thereof to an Affiliate of such Holder or a Related Fund of such Holder without delivering a request to assign or sell such Note to the Company and the recordation of such assignment or sale in the Register (a "Related Party Assignment"); provided, that (x) the Company may continue to deal solely with such assigning or selling Holder unless and until such Holder has delivered a request to assign or sell such Note or portion thereof to the Company for recordation in the Register; (y) the failure of such assigning or selling Holder to deliver a request to assign or sell such Note or portion thereof to the Company shall not affect the legality, validity, or binding effect of such assignment or sale and (z) such assigning or selling Holder shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Company, maintain a register (the "Related Party Register") comparable to the Register on behalf of the Company, and any such assignment or sale shall be effective upon recordation of such assignment or sale in the Related Party Register.
(iv)       Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes.
In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 24.
If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from the Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify the Holder in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause the Holder's beneficial ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 3(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, the Holder must notify the Company of a reduced number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice.
For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Trading Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.
Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other holder of Notes that is not an Attribution Party of the Holder.
 (g)   In the event that the Company shall make any payment or prepayment to the Holder on account of the obligations under this Note which is prohibited by this Section, such payment shall be held by the Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness (pro rata as to each of such holders on the basis of the respective amounts and priorities of Senior Indebtedness held by them) to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness due to such holders of Senior Indebtedness in full in accordance with its terms (whether or not such Senior Indebtedness is due and owing), after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
 (j)    By its acceptance of this Note, the Holder agrees to execute and deliver such documents as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Company or the holder of any Senior Indebtedness in order to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note or any Other Note, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day deliver written notice thereof via facsimile or electronic mail and overnight courier (an "Event of Default Notice") to the Holder.
At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem (an "Event of Default Redemption") all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "Event of Default Redemption Notice") to the Company and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is electing to require the Company to redeem.
The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(a) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, including agreements, if so requested by the Holder, to deliver to each holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the Principal amounts and the Default Rate of the Notes then outstanding held by such holder, having similar conversion rights and having similar ranking to the Notes, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders.
