Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.
Certificates for Shares issued upon exercise of this Warrant will be issued in the name of Holder or and will be delivered to Holder or such named Person or Persons within a reasonable time after the date on which this Warrant has been duly exercised in accordance with the terms of this Warrant.
The Company agrees that the Shares so issued will be deemed to have been issued to the Holder as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant and payment of the Exercise Price are delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Warrant, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company may then be closed or certificates representing such Shares may not be actually delivered on such date.
Upon agreement of the Company and Holder, in lieu of issuing certificates evidencing Shares, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to issue such Shares in book-entry form.
Issuance of certificates for Shares to the Holder upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company.
Transfer/Assignment.
This Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, upon the books of the Company by the registered holder hereof in person or by duly authorized attorney to any Affiliate of such registered holder, and a new warrant shall be made and delivered by the Company, of the same tenor and date as this Warrant but registered in the name of one or more transferees, upon surrender of this Warrant, duly endorsed, to the office or agency of the Company described in Section 3.
Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of a bond, indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company shall make and deliver, in lieu of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and representing the right to purchase the same aggregate number of Shares as provided for in such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant.
(B)      Certain Repurchases of Common Stock.
In any case in which the provisions of this Section 12 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Holder of this Warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Holder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock; provided, however, that the Company upon request shall deliver to such Holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Holder’s right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
(G)     Statement Regarding Adjustments.
Whenever the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in Section 12, the Company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the Company a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the Exercise Price that shall be in effect and the number of Shares into which this Warrant shall be exercisable after such adjustment, and the Company shall also cause a copy of such statement to be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder at the address appearing in the Company’s records.
In the event that the Company shall propose to take any action of the type described in this Section 12 (but only if the action of the type described in this Section 12 would result in an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of this Warrant), the Company shall give notice to the Holder, in the manner set forth in Section 12(G), which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the approximate date on which such action is to take place.
Such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the Exercise Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant.
In the case of any action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 15 days prior to the taking of such proposed action.

A Holder may exercise the conversion rights specified in Section 8(a) by (i) transmitting (by facsimile or otherwise) to the Corporation at its principal office (or at such other office or agency of the Corporation as the Corporation may designate by notice in writing to the Holders) a duly executed irrevocable conversion notice specifying the number of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock to be converted, (ii) if the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted are certificated, surrendering to a common carrier for delivery to the Corporation as soon as practicable following such date the certificates representing the shares being converted (or an indemnification undertaking described in Section 15(a) with respect to such shares in the case of their loss, theft or destruction) and (iii) if required, paying any required stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes which are not payable by the Corporation pursuant to Section 16(b).

Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 11.
For purposes of this Section 14(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Series D Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock acquired by the Corporation (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such acquired shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances.

The Company shall promptly notify Legal Counsel and the Purchaser of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or “blue sky” laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
f.     The Company shall notify Legal Counsel and the Purchaser in writing of the happening of any event, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, as a result of which the Prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material, nonpublic information), and, subject to Section 3(l), promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver ten (10) copies of such supplement or amendment to Legal Counsel and the Purchaser (or such other number of copies as Legal Counsel or the Purchaser may reasonably request).
The Company shall also promptly notify Legal Counsel and the Purchaser in writing (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to Legal Counsel and the Purchaser by facsimile on the same day of such effectiveness and by overnight mail), (ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related Prospectus or related information, and (iii) of the Company’s reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of the Purchaser in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which such Purchaser has entered into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the Prospectus included as part of the applicable Registration Statement (unless an exemption from such prospectus delivery requirements exists), prior to the Purchaser’s receipt of the notice of a Grace Period and for which the Purchaser has not yet settled.
At least ten Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement, the Company shall notify the Purchaser in writing of the information the Company requires from the Purchaser to have any of the Purchaser’s Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which such Purchaser has entered into a contract for sale prior to such Purchaser’s receipt of a notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(g) or the first sentence of Section 3(f) and for which the Purchaser has not yet settled.
In any event, the Company shall not be entitled to deliver more than one Suspension Notice in any one year.
c.     Promptly after receipt by a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Company Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided, however, that a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses of not more than one counsel for such Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.
The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.
