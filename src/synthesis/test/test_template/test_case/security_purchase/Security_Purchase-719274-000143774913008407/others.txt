3.2     Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser.
Purchaser hereby represents and warrants as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date to the Company as follows:
Purchaser is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization with the requisite corporate or other power and authority to enter into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the applicable Transaction Documents and otherwise to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder.
The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action on the part of Purchaser.
Each of this Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement has been duly executed by Purchaser, and when delivered by Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof, will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or similar laws relating to, or affecting generally the enforcement of, creditors’ rights and remedies or by other equitable principles of general application, (ii) as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and (iii) insofar as indemnification and contribution provisions may be limited by applicable law.
The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (i) result in a violation of the organizational documents of Purchaser, (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any material agreement, indenture or instrument to which Purchaser is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state securities laws) applicable to Purchaser, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, defaults, rights or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to perform its obligations hereunder.
Purchaser understands that the Securities are “restricted securities” and have not been registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law and is acquiring the Securities as principal for its own account and not with a view to, or for distributing or reselling such Securities, or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws; provided, that, by making the representations herein, other than as set forth herein, Purchaser does not agree to hold any of the Securities for any minimum period of time and reserves the right at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration and in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws.
Purchaser is acquiring the Securities hereunder in the ordinary course of its business.
Purchaser does not presently have any agreement, plan or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any Person to distribute or effect any distribution of any of the Securities (or any securities that are derivatives thereof) to or through any Person.
At the time Purchaser was offered the Securities it was, and at the date hereof it is, an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act.
Purchaser: (i) became aware of the offering of the Securities, and the Securities were offered to Purchaser, solely by direct contact between Purchaser and the Company, and not by any other means, including any form of “general solicitation” or “general advertising” (as such terms are used in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and interpreted by the Commission); (ii) has entered into no agreements with shareholders of the Company or other subscribers for the purpose of controlling the Company or any of its subsidiaries (except the Investor Rights Agreement and the Prior Investor Rights Agreement); and (iii) has entered into no agreements with shareholders of the Company or other subscribers regarding voting or transferring Purchaser’s interest in the Company (except the Investor Rights Agreement and the prior Investor Rights Agreements dated February 25, 2013 and October 31, 2011).

If the Holder does not exercise this Warrant in its entirety, the Holder will be entitled to receive from the Company within a reasonable time, and in any event not exceeding three business days, a new warrant in substantially identical form for the purchase of that number of Shares equal to the difference between the number of Shares subject to this Warrant and the number of Shares as to which this Warrant is so exercised.

All expenses (other than stock transfer taxes) and other charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the new warrants pursuant to this Section 8 shall be paid by the Company.

The Company shall maintain a registry showing the name and address of the Holder as the registered holder of this Warrant.

If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a business day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding day that is a business day.
Adjustments and Other Rights.
The Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows; provided, that if more than one subsection of this Section 12 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment and no single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one subsection of this Section 12 so as to result in duplication:
If the Company shall (i) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then, in each such case, the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Holder after such date shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock which such Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant after such date had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to such date.
In such event, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12(B) to the contrary, in no event shall any adjustment be made pursuant to this Section 12(B) which would result in an increase to the Exercise Price or a decrease in the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.
In the event of any Business Combination or reclassification of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 12(A)), then, in each such case, the Holder’s right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to receive upon exercise of this Warrant the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such Business Combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such Business Combination or reclassification; and in each such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to the Holder’s right to exercise this Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursuant to this paragraph.
In determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of this Warrant following the consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then the consideration that the Holder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of all holders of the shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).
All calculations under this Section 12 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be.
For so long as the Holder holds this Warrant or any portion thereof, if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this Section 12 are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not, in the good faith judgment of the Board, fairly and adequately protect the purchase rights of the Warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the Board shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the good faith opinion of the Board, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid.
The Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall not be adjusted in the event of a change in the par value of the Common Stock or a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company.
Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this Section 12, the Company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory and other applicable national securities exchange or shareholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all shares of Common Stock that the Holder is entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this Section 12.
Any adjustments pursuant to this Section 12 shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur.
No Impairment.
The Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Holder.
Governing Law.
This Warrant will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of California applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State.
Each of the Company and the Holder agrees (a) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in the State of California for any civil action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) that notice may be served upon the Company at the address in Section 18 below and upon the Holder at the address for the Holder set forth in the registry maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 9 hereof.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Company and the Holder hereby unconditionally waives trial by jury in any civil legal action or proceeding relating to the Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
This Warrant shall be binding upon any successors or assigns of the Company.
This Warrant may be amended and the observance of any term of this Warrant may be waived only with the written consent of the Company and the Holder.
Prohibited Actions.
The Company agrees that it will not take any action which would entitle the Holder to an adjustment of the Exercise Price if the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable after such action upon exercise of this Warrant, together with all shares of Common Stock then outstanding and all shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants, conversion and other rights, would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by its Articles of Incorporation.
This Warrant and the form attached hereto and the Securities Purchase Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous arrangements or undertakings with respect thereto.

Number of Shares; Exercise Price.
The number of Shares and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as provided herein, and all references to “Common Stock,” “Shares” and “Exercise Price” herein shall be deemed to include any such adjustment or series of adjustments.
If the Holder does not exercise this Warrant in its entirety, the Holder will be entitled to receive from the Company within a reasonable time, and in any event not exceeding three business days, a new warrant in substantially identical form for the purchase of that number of Shares equal to the difference between the number of Shares subject to this Warrant and the number of Shares as to which this Warrant is so exercised.
(X) = the number of Shares for which this Warrant is being exercised.
The Company hereby represents and warrants that any Shares issued upon the exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 will be duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges (other than liens or charges created by the Holder, income and franchise taxes incurred in connection with the exercise of the Warrant or taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously therewith).
The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of providing for the exercise of this Warrant, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at any time.
The Company will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Shares may be issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation or of any requirement of any securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or traded, if any.

No Rights as Shareholder.
This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder of the Company prior to the date of exercise hereof.
All expenses (other than stock transfer taxes) and other charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the new warrants pursuant to this Section 8 shall be paid by the Company.
Exchange and Registry of Warrant.
This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the Holder to the Company, for a new warrant or warrants of like tenor and representing the right to purchase the same aggregate number of Shares.
The Company shall maintain a registry showing the name and address of the Holder as the registered holder of this Warrant.
This Warrant may be surrendered for exchange or exercise in accordance with its terms, at the office of the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to rely in all respects, prior to written notice to the contrary, upon such registry.
Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant.
If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a business day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding day that is a business day.
Adjustments and Other Rights.
The Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows; provided, that if more than one subsection of this Section 12 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment and no single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one subsection of this Section 12 so as to result in duplication:
If the Company shall (i) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then, in each such case, the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Holder after such date shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock which such Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant after such date had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to such date.
In such event, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12(B) to the contrary, in no event shall any adjustment be made pursuant to this Section 12(B) which would result in an increase to the Exercise Price or a decrease in the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.
In the event of any Business Combination or reclassification of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 12(A)), then, in each such case, the Holder’s right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to receive upon exercise of this Warrant the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such Business Combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such Business Combination or reclassification; and in each such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to the Holder’s right to exercise this Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursuant to this paragraph.
In determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of this Warrant following the consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then the consideration that the Holder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of all holders of the shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).
All calculations under this Section 12 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be.
For so long as the Holder holds this Warrant or any portion thereof, if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this Section 12 are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not, in the good faith judgment of the Board, fairly and adequately protect the purchase rights of the Warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the Board shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the good faith opinion of the Board, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid.
The Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall not be adjusted in the event of a change in the par value of the Common Stock or a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company.
Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this Section 12, the Company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory and other applicable national securities exchange or shareholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all shares of Common Stock that the Holder is entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this Section 12.
Any adjustments pursuant to this Section 12 shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur.
No Impairment.
The Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Holder.
Governing Law.
This Warrant will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of California applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State.
Each of the Company and the Holder agrees (a) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in the State of California for any civil action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) that notice may be served upon the Company at the address in Section 18 below and upon the Holder at the address for the Holder set forth in the registry maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 9 hereof.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Company and the Holder hereby unconditionally waives trial by jury in any civil legal action or proceeding relating to the Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
This Warrant shall be binding upon any successors or assigns of the Company.
This Warrant may be amended and the observance of any term of this Warrant may be waived only with the written consent of the Company and the Holder.
Prohibited Actions.
The Company agrees that it will not take any action which would entitle the Holder to an adjustment of the Exercise Price if the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable after such action upon exercise of this Warrant, together with all shares of Common Stock then outstanding and all shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants, conversion and other rights, would exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by its Articles of Incorporation.
This Warrant and the form attached hereto and the Securities Purchase Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous arrangements or undertakings with respect thereto.

(f) If the applicable Conversion Date with respect to any share of Series D Preferred Stock is prior to any Distribution Record Date, the Holder of such share of Series D Preferred Stock will not have the right to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to such Distribution Record Date.
If the applicable Conversion Date with respect to any share of Series D Preferred Stock is after the Distribution Record Date for any declared dividend or other distribution and prior to the payment date for that dividend or distribution, the Holder thereof shall receive that dividend or distribution on the relevant payment date if such Holder was the Holder of record on the Distribution Record Date for that dividend.

After payment of the full amount of such liquidation distribution, the Holders shall not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the Corporation.
(b) In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to shareholders upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on any Parity Securities, the Holders and the holders of such Parity Securities shall share ratably in any distribution of assets of the Corporation in proportion to the full respective liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.
(c) The Corporation’s consolidation or merger with or into any other entity, the consolidation or merger of any other entity with or into the Corporation, or any similar business combination will not constitute its liquidation, dissolution or winding up for purposes of this Section 5.

Section 9.
Conversion Procedures.
Subject to the Holder’s compliance with the foregoing, a share of Series D Preferred Stock (or portion thereof) which such Holder has elected to convert shall be deemed to have been converted effective as of the close of business on the day of Holder’s conversion notice or, if such conversion notice is received after the close of business or on a day which is not a Business Day, as of the close of business on the next Business Day (the “Conversion Date”).
(d) Shares of Series D Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with this Certificate of Determination, or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation, will resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance.
The Corporation may from time-to-time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock; provided that the Corporation shall not take any such action if such action would reduce the authorized number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock below the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding.
(e) The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock and/or cash, securities or other property issuable upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock and/or securities as of the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date with respect thereto.
Section 10.
Anti-Dilution Adjustments.
OS0 =
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for the applicable dividend or distribution, and
OS1 =
the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution plus the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or distribution.
For the purposes of this clause (i), the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding shall not include any shares which have been reacquired by the Corporation.
If any dividend or distribution described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board publicly announces its decision not to make such dividend or distribution, to such Conversion Price that would be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
If the Corporation subdivides, splits or combines the shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted such that the Conversion Price on and after the effective time of such share subdivision, split or combination will equal the product of (x) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the effective time of such share subdivision, split or combination, multiplied by (y) the following fraction:
Where,
        OS0 =
  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the applicable share subdivision, split or combination, and
      OS1 =
  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of such share subdivision, split or combination.
OS0 =
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the applicable share subdivision, split or combination, and
OS1 =
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of such share subdivision, split or combination.
For the purposes of this clause (ii), the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding shall not include any shares which have been reacquired by the Corporation.
If any subdivision, split or combination described in this clause (ii) is announced but the shares of Common Stock are not subdivided, split or combined, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board publicly announces its decision not to subdivide, split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, to such Conversion Price that would be in effect if such subdivision, split or combination had not been announced.
To the extent that the Corporation has a rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on the applicable Conversion Date, upon conversion of any shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, Holders will receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan, unless, prior to the applicable Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Price will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in clause (iii) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration or termination of such rights.
(ii) No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if Holders participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment as a result of holding the Series D Preferred Stock, without having to convert the Series D Preferred Stock, as if they held the full number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of the Series D Preferred Stock may then be converted.
Section 11.
Reorganization Events.
(any such event specified in this Section 11(a), a “Reorganization Event”); then each share of such Holder’s Series D Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall remain outstanding but shall thereafter automatically entitle the Holder to receive, upon conversion of such share of Series D Preferred Stock, the type and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event by a holder (excluding the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an Affiliate of such counterparty) of the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing (x) the Liquidation Preference, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, whether or not declared, up to, but excluding the effective date of the Reorganization Event, by (y) the Applicable Conversion Price as of such date (such securities, cash and other property, the “Exchange Property”).
(b) In the event that holders of the shares of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration that the Holders are entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of the holders of the shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election.
(c) The above provisions of this Section 11 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 10 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.
(e) The Corporation shall not enter into any agreement for a transaction constituting a Reorganization Event unless such agreement provides for or does not interfere with or prevent (as applicable) conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock into the Exchange Property in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to this Section 11.
Section 12.
Voting Rights.
(a) For each share of Series D Preferred Stock held as of an applicable record date, each Holder shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the Series D Voting Rate (determined as of such record date) on any matter that is submitted to a vote or for the consent of the shareholders of the Corporation (including, without limitation, election of directors), and, except as otherwise required by law or as set forth herein, shall have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock, shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation and shall be entitled to vote together with the holders of Common Stock voting as a single class with respect to any matter upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote.

g.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time after the Effective Date, the Company may delay the disclosure of material, non-public information concerning the Company the disclosure of which at the time is not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company and its counsel, in the best interest of the Company and, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, otherwise required (a “Grace Period”); provided, that the Company shall promptly (i) notify the Purchaser in writing of the existence of material, non-public information giving rise to a Grace Period (provided that in each notice the Company will not disclose the content of such material, non-public information to the Purchaser) and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, and (ii) notify the Purchaser in writing of the date on which the Grace Period ends; and, provided further, that no Grace Period shall exceed sixty (60) consecutive days and during any three hundred sixty five (365) day period such Grace Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of one hundred twenty (120) days and the first day of any Grace Period must be at least two (2) trading days after the last day of any prior Grace Period.

The Purchaser, by its acceptance of the Registrable Securities, agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration Statement hereunder, unless such Purchaser has notified the Company in writing of its election to exclude all of such Purchaser’s Registrable Securities from such Registration Statement.
d.     The Purchaser covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it or an exemption therefrom in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement.

Indemnification.
In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement:
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will, and hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Purchaser, the directors, officers, managers, members, partners, employees, agents, representatives of, and each Person, if any, who controls the Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, a “Purchaser Indemnified Party”), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs, attorneys’ fees, amounts paid in settlement or expenses, joint or several, (collectively, “Claims”) incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency, body or the Commission, whether pending or threatened, whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto (“Indemnified Damages”), to which any of them may become subject insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in any filing made in connection with the qualification of the offering under the securities or other “blue sky” laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered (“Blue Sky Filing”), or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus or free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, or (iii) any violation of this Agreement (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) being, collectively, “Violations”).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a): shall not apply to a Claim (a) arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Purchaser Indemnified Party expressly for use in any Prospectus or supplement thereto or the omission or alleged omission in such written information to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such Prospectus or supplement thereto was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d); (b) to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of such Purchaser Indemnified Party to deliver or to cause to be delivered the Prospectus made available by the Company, including a corrected Prospectus, if such Prospectus or corrected Prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d); (c) in which amounts are paid in settlement of any Claim and such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (d) in which such Purchaser Indemnified Party fails to cease all offers and sales of Registrable Securities in accordance with Section 4(c) herein, to the extent such Claim is based on such failure; and (e) arising out of or based solely upon a breach by such Purchaser Indemnified Party of such Purchaser Indemnified Party’s obligations set forth herein.
This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.
In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Purchaser is participating, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such Purchaser agrees to severally and not jointly indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Company and each of its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an “Company Indemnified Party”), against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in any filing made in connection with a Blue Sky Filing, or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus or free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission of a material fact is contained in any written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement; and, subject to Section 6(c), such Purchaser will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by an Company Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of such Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and provided further, that the obligation to indemnify shall be limited to the net proceeds (after underwriting fees, commissions or discounts) actually received by such holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.
In the case of a Purchaser Indemnified Party, legal counsel referred to in the immediately preceding sentence shall be selected by the Required Holders.
The Company Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Company Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party which relates to such action or Claim.
The indemnifying party shall keep the Company Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party reasonably apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.
No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent.
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the Company Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Company Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such Claim or litigation, and such settlement shall not include any admission as to fault on the part of the Company Indemnified Party.
Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Company Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.
d.     The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred.

Contribution.
To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that: (i) no Person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities which Person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution from any Person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant hereto were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method or allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein.

Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 9 shall be binding upon the Purchaser and the Company.

Preservation of Rights.
Except with the prior consent of the Required Holders, the Company shall not, for so long as there are Registrable Securities, (a) grant any registration rights to third parties that are inconsistent with the rights granted hereunder, or (b) enter into any agreement, take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to its securities that violates or subordinates the rights expressly granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement.
