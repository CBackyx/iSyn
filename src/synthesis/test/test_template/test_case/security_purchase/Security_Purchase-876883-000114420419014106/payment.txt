Section 6.06         Expenses.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein (including Section 4.05, Section 4.08, Section 5.04 and Section 5.05), each party hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; provided, that within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Company shall reimburse the Purchaser and its Affiliates in same day funds for their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and consultants) incurred in connection with the execution of this Agreement and the purchase by the Purchaser of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such reimbursable expenses shall not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate.
   EXHIBIT B FORM OF ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT   ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT PROVISIONS ATTACHING TO THESERIES 6 CONVERTIBLE PREFERENCE SHARES To increase the authorized capital of the Corporation by creating a sixth series of preference shares of the Corporation (the “Preference Shares”), which shall consist of 50,000 shares designated as the “Series 6 Convertible Preference Shares” (the “Convertible Preference Shares”).
(i)          Following the occurrence of a Specified Event, each holder of issued and outstanding Convertible Preference Shares will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends for each Convertible Preference Share, with respect to each Dividend Period, dividends at a rate per annum equal to the Additional Rate multiplied by the Base Liquidation Preference per Convertible Preference Share (the “Additional Dividends” and, together with Participating Dividends, the “Dividends”).
The amount of Additional Dividends payable for any Dividend Period shorter or longer than a full quarterly Dividend Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Any payment of an Additional Dividend will first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid Additional Dividend due with respect to each share that remains payable.
(c)          The Corporation shall pay Dividends (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld by the Corporation), except in case of redemption or conversion in which case payment of Dividends shall be made on surrender of the certificate, if any, representing the Convertible Preference Shares to be redeemed or converted, by electronic funds transfer or by sending to each holder of Convertible Preference Shares a check for such Dividends payable to the order of such holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of all such holders failing written instructions from them to the contrary or in such other manner, not contrary to applicable law, as the Corporation shall reasonably determine.
The making of such payment or the posting or delivery of such check on or before the date on which such Dividend is to be paid to a holder shall be deemed to be payment and shall satisfy and discharge all liabilities for the payment of such Dividends to the extent of the sum represented thereby (plus the amount of any tax required to be and in fact deducted and withheld by the Corporation from the related Dividends as aforesaid and remitted to the proper taxing authority) unless such check is not honored when presented for payment.
From and after the Series 6 Original Issuance Date, the Base Liquidation Preference of each Convertible Preference Share shall increase on a daily basis, on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at a rate of 8.0% per annum (the “Accretion Rate”) of the then-applicable Base Liquidation Preference, the amount of which increase shall compound quarterly on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (each, a “Quarterly Compounding Date”) from the Series 6 Original Issuance Date through the fifth anniversary thereof, following which the Accretion Rate will decrease to 0% per annum and the Base Liquidation Preference per Convertible Preference Share will not increase during any period subsequent to such fifth anniversary.
Purchase for Cancellation.
Subject to such provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act as may be applicable, the Corporation may at any time or times purchase (if obtainable) for cancellation all or any part of the Convertible Preference Shares outstanding from time to time: (a) through the facilities of any Exchange or market on which the Convertible Preference Shares are listed, (b) by invitation for tenders addressed to all the holders of record of the Convertible Preference Shares outstanding, or (c) in any other manner, in each case at the lowest price or prices at which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, such shares are obtainable.
The “Conversion Price” initially is $5.00 per share, as adjusted from time to time as provided in SECTION 5(f).
If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this SECTION 5(f)(i)(A) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
In each such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination and the denominator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision, combination or reclassification.
If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time, while any Convertible Preference Shares are outstanding, distribute rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all holders of its Class A Shares entitling them, for a period expiring within sixty (60) days after the record date for such distribution, to purchase Class A Shares, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Class A Shares, in either case, at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the distribution, then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution by a fraction:    (A)         the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of Class A Shares Outstanding on the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, plus (2) the number of Class A Shares that the aggregate offering price of the total number of Class A Shares issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants would purchase at the Current Market Price of the Class A Shares on the declaration date for such distribution (determined by multiplying such total number of Class A Shares so offered by the exercise price of such rights, options or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by such Current Market Price); and (B)         the denominator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares Outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, plus the total number of additional Class A Shares issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants.
In the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had not occurred.
Except as set forth in this paragraph, in no event shall the Conversion Price be increased pursuant to this SECTION 5(f)(ii).
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Price pursuant to this SECTION 5(f)(iii) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.
In the event that the Corporation or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase Class A Shares pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.
In the case of the issuance of Additional Class A Shares for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price will not be reduced if the amount of such reduction would be an amount less than $0.01, but any such amount will be carried forward and reduction with respect thereto will be made at the time that such amount, together with any subsequent amounts so carried forward, aggregates to $0.01 or more.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Articles of Amendment, in no event shall the Conversion Price be adjusted pursuant to Section 5(f)(v) to a price that is less than the lower of: (i) the closing price of the Class A Shares (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of the Securities Purchase Agreement; or (ii) the average closing price of the Class A Shares (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the Securities Purchase Agreement.
(i)          In connection with or following any Specified Event, the Corporation, at its option and (if applicable) subject to consummation of such Specified Event, may redeem (out of funds legally available therefor) for cash all of the Convertible Preference Shares then outstanding at a price (the “Redemption Price”) per Convertible Preference Share equal to the greater of (i) the Base Liquidation Preference per such Convertible Preference Share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon and (ii) an amount equal to the amount the holder of such Convertible Preference Shares would have received in respect of such Convertible Preference Share had such holder converted such Convertible Preference Share into Class A Shares immediately prior to such redemption based on the Current Market Price, in each case on the date of redemption (the “Redemption Date”).
If the Class A Shares are not so quoted, the last reported sale price will be the average of the mid-point of the last bid and ask prices for the Class A Shares on the relevant date from each of at least three (3) nationally recognized investment banking firms selected by the Corporation for this purpose.
(aa)        “Original Purchase Price” means $1,000 per Convertible Preference Share.
If a payment is made by way of a wire or electronic transfer of funds, the Corporation shall be responsible for any applicable charges or fees relating to the making of such transfer.
The making of a payment by way of a wire or electronic transfer of funds or the deposit by the Corporation of funds otherwise payable to a holder in a special account or accounts in trust for such holder shall be deemed to constitute payment by the Corporation on the date thereof and shall satisfy and discharge all liabilities of the Corporation for such payment to the extent of the amount represented by such transfer or deposit.
Unless otherwise stated, all references herein to sums of money are expressed in lawful money of the United States.
The amount specified in respect of each Convertible Preference Shares for the purposes of subsection 191(4) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) is $1,000.
(c)          The Corporation shall pay Participating Dividends (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld by the Corporation), except in case of redemption or conversion in which case payment of Participating Dividends shall be made on surrender of the certificate, if any, representing the Convertible Preference Shares to be redeemed or converted, by electronic funds transfer or by sending to each holder of Convertible Preference Shares a check for such Participating Dividends payable to the order of such holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of all such holders failing written instructions from them to the contrary or in such other manner, not contrary to applicable law, as the Corporation shall reasonably determine.
The making of such payment or the posting or delivery of such check on or before the date on which such Dividend is to be paid to a holder shall be deemed to be payment and shall satisfy and discharge all liabilities for the payment of such Dividends to the extent of the sum represented thereby (plus the amount of any tax required to be and in fact deducted and withheld by the Corporation from the related Dividends as aforesaid and remitted to the proper taxing authority) unless such check is not honored when presented for payment.

In each such case, the Conversion Amount shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Amount by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination and the denominator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision, combination or reclassification.
If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time, while any Convertible Preference Shares are outstanding, distribute rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all holders of its Class A Shares entitling them, for a period expiring within sixty (60) days after the record date for such distribution, to purchase Class A Shares, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Class A Shares, in either case, at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the distribution, then the Conversion Amount shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Amount in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution by a fraction: (A)         the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of Class A Shares Outstanding on the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, plus (2) the number of Class A Shares that the aggregate offering price of the total number of Class A Shares issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants would purchase at the Current Market Price of the Class A Shares on the declaration date for such distribution (determined by multiplying such total number of Class A Shares so offered by the exercise price of such rights, options or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by such Current Market Price); and (B)         the denominator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares Outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, plus the total number of additional Class A Shares issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants.
