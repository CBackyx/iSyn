subject to a maximum rate of (i) 4.00% with respect to each Distribution Date prior to the Distribution Date in January 2007, (ii) 8.00% with respect each Distribution Date on or after the

the Distribution Date in January 2010, or (iv) 0.00% on or after the Distribution Date in January 2010.
(2)For each Distribution Date, this Lower Tier Interest shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of  (i) 2 multiplied by the weighted average Net Mortgage Rate of the Mortgage Loans in Pool 1 over (ii) the REMIC Swap Rate for such Distribution Date.
(3)For each Distribution Date, this Lower Tier Interest shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the weighted average Net Mortgage Rate of the Mortgage Loans in Pool 2 multiplied by 2, subject to the REMIC Swap Rate for such Distribution Date.
(4)For each Distribution Date, this Lower Tier Interest shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of  (i) 2 multiplied by the weighted average Net Mortgage Rate of the Mortgage Loans in Pool 2 over (ii) the REMIC Swap Rate for such Distribution Date.
(5)This Lower Tier Interest shall have an initial principal balance equal to the excess of (i) the Pool Balance of Pool 1 as of the Cut-off Date over (ii) the aggregate principal balance of the Lower Tier Interests in REMIC 1 whose class designation ends with “-1.”(6)For each Distribution Date, this Lower Tier Interest shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the weighted average Net Mortgage Rate of the Mortgage Loans in Pool 1.
(7)This Lower Tier Interest shall have an initial principal balance equal to the excess of (i) the Pool Balance of Pool 2 as of the Cut-off Date over (ii) the aggregate principal balance of the Lower Tier Interests in REMIC 2 whose class designation ends with “-2.”(8)For each Distribution Date, this Lower Tier Interest shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the weighted average Net Mortgage Rate of the Mortgage Loans in Pool 2.
On each Distribution Date, interest distributable in respect of the Mortgage Loans for such Distribution Date shall be deemed to be distributed to the Lower Tier Interests in REMIC 1 at the rates shown above.On each Distribution Date, Realized Losses and payments of principal in respect of the Mortgage Loans in Pool 1 shall be allocated in the following order:(i)first, to the Class LT1-Pool 1 Interest until its class principal balance is reduced to zero; and(ii)second, to the outstanding Lower Tier Interest in REMIC 1 ending with the term “-1” in its designation with the lowest numerical denomination until such interest is reduced to zero, provided that, for Lower Tier Interests with the same numerical denomination, such Realized Losses and payments of principal shall be allocated pro rata between such Lower Tier Interests.On each Distribution Date, Realized Losses and payments of principal in respect of the Mortgage Loans in Pool 2 shall be allocated in the following order:(i)first, to the Class LT1-Pool 2 Interest until its class principal balance is reduced to zero; and(ii)second, to the outstanding Lower Tier Interest in REMIC 1 ending with the term “-2” in its designation with the lowest numerical denomination until such interest is reduced to zero, provided that, for Lower Tier Interests with the same numerical denomination, such Realized Losses and payments of principal shall be allocated pro rata between such Lower Tier Interests.On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall be deemed to have distributed the Prepayment Penalties collected during the preceding Prepayment Period with respect to Pool 1 and Pool 2, in the case of Principal Prepayments in full, or during the related Collection Period, in the case of Principal Prepayments in part, to the Class LT1-I-59A-1 and Class LT1-I-59A-2 Lower Tier Interests, respectively.REMIC 2:The following table sets forth the designations, principal balances and interest rates for each interest in

For each of the first six Distribution Dates, this Lower Tier Interest shall be entitled to receive interest that accrues on the Class LT1-I-5A-1 Lower Tier Interest at a rate equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the interest rate of the Class LT1-I-5A-1 over (ii) 2 times Swap LIBOR, computed on an actual/360 basis, provided that, on the first Distribution Date, this lower tier interest shall not be entitled to receive any interest.
For each of the first seven Distribution Dates, this Lower Tier Interest shall be entitled to receive interest that accrues on the Class LT1-I-6A-1 Lower Tier Interest at a rate equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the interest rate of the Class LT1-I-6A-1 over (ii) 2 times Swap LIBOR, computed on an actual/360 basis, provided that, on the first Distribution Date, this lower tier interest shall not be entitled to receive any interest.
For each of the first eight Distribution Dates, this Lower Tier Interest shall be entitled to receive interest that accrues on the Class LT1-I-7A-1 Lower Tier Interest at a rate equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the interest rate of the Class LT1-I-7A-1 over (ii) 2 times Swap LIBOR, computed on an actual/360 basis, provided that, on the first Distribution Date, this lower tier interest shall not be entitled to receive any interest.
For each of the first nine Distribution Dates, this Lower Tier Interest shall be entitled to receive interest that accrues on the Class LT1-I-8A-1 Lower Tier Interest at a rate equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the interest rate of the Class LT1-I-8A-1 over (ii) 2 times Swap LIBOR, computed on an actual/360 basis, provided that, on the first Distribution Date, this lower tier interest shall not be entitled to receive any interest.
For each of the first ten Distribution Dates, this Lower Tier Interest shall be entitled to receive interest that accrues on the Class LT1-I-9A-1 Lower Tier Interest at a rate equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the interest rate of the Class LT1-I-9A-1 over (ii) 2 times Swap LIBOR, computed on an actual/360 basis, provided that, on the first Distribution Date, this lower tier interest shall not be entitled to receive any interest.
