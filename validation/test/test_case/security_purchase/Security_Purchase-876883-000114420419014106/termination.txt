(e)          Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Company be obligated to take any action to effect (i) more than two (2) Underwritten Offerings initiated by holders of Registrable Securities in any consecutive 12-month period, or (ii) more than three (3) Underwritten Offerings in total.
(a)          If and whenever the Company is required to use reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act and in connection with any distribution of Registered Securities pursuant thereto as provided in this Agreement (including any sale referred to in any Take-Down Notice), the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement:
(ii)         subject to Section 5.02, prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary and to the extent required by applicable law to keep such Registration Statement effective and Available pursuant to the terms of this Article V;
(iii)        if requested by the lead managing underwriter(s), promptly include in a prospectus supplement such information as the lead managing underwriter(s), if any, and such holders may reasonably request in order to permit the intended method of distribution of such securities and make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company has received such request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to take any actions under this Section 5.03(a)(iii) that are not, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, in compliance with applicable law;
(v)         if such Registrable Securities are Class A Shares, use reasonable efforts to cause such Class A Shares to be listed on NASDAQ (or if the Class A Shares are no longer listed on NASDAQ, on such other national securities exchange on which the Class A Shares may then be listed), provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to seek or obtain any shareholder approval in order to satisfy any stock exchange requirements in connection with such listing;
(vi)        use reasonable efforts to provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar (which may be the Company) for all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement;
(ix)         cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and each underwriter or agent participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.;
(x)          prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the Selling Holders in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the applicable state securities or “blue sky” laws of those jurisdictions within the United States as any holder reasonably requests in writing to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective until the Registration Termination Date; provided, that the Company will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of this clause (x) be obligated to be so qualified, (B) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction;
(c)          Each Selling Holder agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in clauses (B), (C), (D), (E) and (F) of Section 5.03(a)(vii), such Selling Holder shall forthwith discontinue such Selling Holder’s disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement and prospectus relating thereto until such Selling Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such prospectus.
(b)          In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Selling Holder is participating, without limitation as to time, each such Selling Holder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify the Company, its directors and officers, and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, from and against all Losses, as incurred, arising out of, caused by, resulting from or relating to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (without limitation of the preceding portions of this Section 5.05(b)) will reimburse the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and defending or settling any such claim, Loss, damage, liability or action, in each case solely to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is made in such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information regarding the Selling Holder furnished to the Company by such Selling Holder for inclusion in such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c)          Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligation, except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to provide such notice on a timely basis.
(e)          The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall survive the sale or other transfer of the Registrable Securities and the termination of this Agreement.
(f)           If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions for any reason or reasons other than as specified therein, any Person who would otherwise be entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution with respect to any Losses with respect to which such Person would be entitled to such indemnification but for such reason or reasons, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
(g)          The indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Section 5.05 are in addition to any liability that the indemnifying party may have to the indemnified party and do not limit other provisions of this Agreement that provide for indemnification.
(a)          If, at any time following the Restricted Period, the Company proposes to sell Class A Shares for its own account with a market value of at least $25,000,000 in an Underwritten Offering (other than pursuant to Section 5.01 and other than Class A Shares issued or issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of securities other than Preferred Shares), and the Registration Statement to be filed may be used for the registration or qualification for distribution of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall use reasonable efforts to give written notice of such filing to the Purchaser at least ten (10) Business Days before the anticipated filing date (or such later date as it becomes commercially reasonable to provide such notice) (the “Piggyback Notice”).
The Company may terminate or withdraw any registration under this Section 5.08 prior to the effectiveness of such registration or the pricing of such Underwritten Offering, whether or not the Purchaser has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration.
(b)          If the managing underwriter(s) advise the Company in writing that it is their good faith opinion that the total amount of Registrable Securities requested to be so included in such Piggyback Registration exceeds the total number or dollar amount of such securities that can be sold without having an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall include in such Underwritten Offering the number or dollar amount of Registrable Securities that in the good faith opinion of such managing underwriter(s) can be sold without so adversely affecting such offering, and such number of Registrable Securities and other Class A Shares shall be allocated for inclusion as follows: (i) first, the securities the Company proposes to sell; and (ii) second, Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by the Purchaser and any other third parties, on a pro rata basis based on the number of Class A Shares requested to be sold.
If requested by the managing underwriter of any such underwritten offering, the Purchaser shall execute a separate agreement to the foregoing effect; provided, that if any such lock-up agreement (x) for any shareholder provides for exceptions from any restrictions contained therein, such exceptions shall automatically apply equally to the Purchaser or (y) is terminated or waived in whole or in part for any shareholder, other than a de minimis waiver, such termination or waiver shall automatically apply to the Purchaser on a pro rata basis based on the number of Class A Shares owned by such shareholder and the Purchaser.
An Opt-Out Request may state a date on which it expires or, if no such date is specified, shall remain in effect indefinitely.
An Opt-Out Request may be revoked by the Purchaser at any time, and there shall be no limit on the ability of the Purchaser to issue and revoke subsequent Opt-Out Requests; provided that the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the administrative burden on the Company arising in connection with any such Opt-Out Requests.
Except for the warranties and representations contained in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 3.01 and the representations and warranties contained in clauses (a), (b)(i), (b)(iii), (d), (e) and (h) of Section 3.02, the warranties and representations made herein shall survive for one (1) year following the Closing Date and shall then expire and the warranties and representations contained in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 3.01 and the representations and warranties contained in clauses (a), (b)(i), (b)(iii), (d), (e) and (h) of Section 3.02 shall survive until the statute of limitations applicable thereto and shall then expire; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party of liability for any inaccuracy or breach of such representation or warranty to the extent that any good faith allegation of such inaccuracy or breach is made in writing prior to such expiration.

Section 6.13         Termination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties to this Agreement provided herein, shall terminate, and be of no further force or effect, upon the closing of a Qualifying Transaction; provided, that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of liability for any breach or default under this Agreement by such party that occurred prior to such termination; provided, further, Section 6.12 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
(a)          Participating Dividends.
(i)          Each holder of issued and outstanding Convertible Preference Shares will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends for each Convertible Preference Share, dividends of the same type as any dividends or other distribution, whether in cash, in kind or in other property, payable or to be made on outstanding Class A Subordinate Voting Shares of the Corporation (the “Class A Shares”), in an amount equal to the amount of such dividends or other distribution as would be made on the number of Class A Shares into which such Convertible Preference Shares could be converted on the applicable record date for such dividends or other distribution on the Class A Shares, without giving effect to the limitations set forth in SECTION 5(b) after aggregating all shares held by the same holder (the “Participating Dividends”) and disregarding any rounding for fractional amounts; provided, however, that notwithstanding the above, the holders of Convertible Preference Shares shall not be entitled to receive any dividends or distributions for which an adjustment to the Conversion Price (as defined below) shall be made pursuant to SECTION 5(f)(i)(A) or SECTION 5(f)(ii) (and such dividends or distributions that are not payable to the holders of Convertible Preference Shares as a result of this proviso shall not be deemed to be Participating Dividends).
(ii)         Participating Dividends are payable at the same time as and when such dividends or other distributions on the Class A Shares are paid to the holders of Class A Shares and are payable to holders of record of Convertible Preference Shares on the record date for the corresponding dividend or distribution on the Class A Shares.
(b)          Additional Dividends.
(ii)         Additional Dividends will accrue on a daily basis and be cumulative from the date on which a Specified Event occurs and are payable in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date.
(iii)        Additional Dividends in respect of any Dividend Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
(iv)        Additional Dividends that are declared and payable on a Dividend Payment Date will be paid to the holders of record of Convertible Preference Shares as they appear in the records of the Corporation at the close of business on the 15th day of the calendar month prior to the month in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls, provided that Additional Dividends payable upon redemption or conversion of Convertible Preference Shares will be payable to the holder of record on the Redemption Date or the Conversion Date, as applicable.
(v)         Additional Dividends are payable only in cash.
(vi)        After a Specified Event has occurred and while any Convertible Preference Shares remain outstanding, unless all Additional Dividends accrued to the end of all completed Dividend Periods have been paid in full, neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may (A) declare, pay or set aside for payment any dividends or distributions on any Junior Securities or (B) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Junior Securities.
(vii)       The provisions of SECTION 1(b)(vi) shall not prohibit: (A)         the repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition of vested or unvested Common Shares held by any future, present or former officer, director, employee, manager or consultant (or their respective permitted transferees) of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation pursuant to any equity incentive grant, plan, program or arrangement, any severance agreement or any stock subscription or equityholder agreement, in each case solely to the extent required by the terms thereof; (B)         payments made or expected to be made by the Corporation in respect of withholding or similar taxes payable in connection with the exercise or vesting of Common Shares or Class A Equivalents by any future, present or former officer, director, employee, manager or consultant (or their respective permitted transferees) of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation and repurchases or withholdings of Common Shares or Class A Equivalents in connection with any exercise or vesting of Common Shares or Class A Equivalents if such Common Shares or Class A Equivalents represent all or a portion of the exercise price of, or withholding obligation with respect to, such Common Shares or Class A Equivalents; (C)         cash payments made in lieu of issuing fractional Common Shares in connection with the exercise or vesting of Common Shares or Class A Equivalents; (D)         payments arising from agreements of the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation providing for adjustment of purchase price, deferred consideration, earn outs or similar obligations, in each case incurred in connection with the purchase or investment by the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation of or in assets or capital stock of a third party; or    (E)         payments or distributions made pursuant to any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation or pursuant to any decree or order for relief or made by any custodian of the Corporation in connection with any voluntary case or proceeding under Title 11 of the U.S. Code or any similar federal, state, Canadian, provincial or other non-U.S. law for the relief of debtors.
(d)          Holders of the Convertible Preference Shares are not entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash, in kind or other property, in excess of the Participating Dividends and, if applicable, the Additional Dividends, as provided in this SECTION 1.
(a)          Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, each Convertible Preference Share entitles the holder thereof to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution, before any distribution or payment may be made to a holder of any Class A Shares, any Class B Shares of the Corporation (the “Class B Shares”) or any other shares ranking junior as to capital to the Convertible Preference Shares, an amount per Convertible Preference Share equal to the greater of (i) the Base Liquidation Preference (as defined below), as increased by the Accretion Rate (as defined below) from the most recent Quarterly Compounding Date to the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up (without duplication of changes to the Base Liquidation Preference as provided for in SECTION 2(b)) plus any accrued but unpaid Dividends with respect thereto, and (ii) an amount equal to the amount the holders of the Convertible Preference Shares would have received per Convertible Preference Share upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation had such holders converted their Convertible Preference Shares into Class A Shares immediately prior thereto, without giving effect to the limitations set forth in SECTION 5(b) and disregarding any rounding for fractional amounts (the greater of the amount in clause (i) and clause (ii), the “Liquidation Preference”).
(b)          The “Base Liquidation Preference” per Convertible Preference Share shall initially be equal to the Original Purchase Price.
(c)          After payment to the holders of the Convertible Preference Shares of the full Liquidation Preference to which they are entitled, the Convertible Preference Shares as such will have no right or claim to any of the assets of the Corporation.
(d)          The value of any property not consisting of cash that is distributed by the Corporation to the holders of the Convertible Preference Shares will equal the Fair Market Value thereof on the date of distribution.

(a)          Conversion at the Option of Holders of Convertible Preference Shares.
(b)          Limitations on Conversion.
(c)          Conversion at the Option of the Corporation.
(d)          Fractional Shares.
(e)          Mechanics of Conversion.
(ii)         From and after the Conversion Date, the Convertible Preference Shares to be converted on such Conversion Date will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the holder thereof as a holder of Convertible Preference Shares (except the right to receive from the Corporation the Class A Shares upon conversion, together with the right to receive any accrued and unpaid Dividends thereon) shall cease and terminate with respect to such shares; provided, that in the event that a Convertible Preference Share is not converted, such Convertible Preference Share will remain outstanding and will be entitled to all of the rights as provided herein.
(iii)        If the conversion is in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preference Shares, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering any Convertible Preference Share for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of the sale, transfer or the disposition of Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preference Shares with the underwriter, transferee or other acquirer in such sale, transfer or disposition, in which event such conversion of such Convertible Preference Shares shall not be deemed to have occurred until immediately prior to the closing of such sale, transfer or other disposition.
(f)           Adjustments to Conversion Price.
(i)          Adjustment for Change In Share Capital.
(A)         If the Corporation shall, at any time and from time to time while any Convertible Preference Shares are outstanding, issue a dividend or make a distribution on its Class A Shares payable in its Class A Shares to all or substantially all holders of its Class A Shares, then the Conversion Price at the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution will be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction: (1)         the numerator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Ex-Dividend Date; and (2)         the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of Class A Shares outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, plus the total number of Class A Shares constituting such dividend or other distribution.
(B)         If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Convertible Preference Shares are outstanding, subdivide or reclassify its outstanding Class A Shares into a greater number of Class A Shares, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately decreased, and conversely, if the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Convertible Preference Shares are outstanding, combine or reclassify its outstanding Class A Shares into a smaller number of Class A Shares, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased.
(ii)         Adjustment for Rights Issue.
(iii)        Adjustment for Certain Tender Offers or Exchange Offers.
(iv)        Disposition Events.
(A)         If any of the following events (any such event, a “Disposition Event”) occurs: (1)         any reclassification or exchange of the Class A Shares (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination); (2)         any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or other combination to which the Corporation is a constituent party; or (3)         any sale, conveyance, lease, or other disposal of all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Corporation to any other person;    in each case, as a result of which all of the holders of Class A Shares shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property for their Class A Shares, the Convertible Preference Shares converted following the effective date of any Disposition Event shall be converted, in lieu of the Class A Shares otherwise deliverable, into the same amount and type (in the same proportion) of cash, securities or other property received by holders of Class A Shares in the relevant event (collectively, “Reference Property”) received upon the occurrence of such Disposition Event by a holder of Class A Shares holding, immediately prior to the transaction, a number of Class A Shares equal to the Conversion Amount (without giving effect to any limitations on conversion set forth in SECTION 5(b)) immediately prior to such Disposition Event; provided that if the Disposition Event provides the holders of Class A Shares with the right to receive more than a single type of consideration determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, the Reference Property shall be comprised of the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Class A Shares.
(B)         The above provisions of this SECTION 5(f)(iv) shall similarly apply to successive Disposition Events.
(v)         Adjustment for Certain Issuances of Additional Class A Shares.
(A)         Other than in respect of an issuance or distribution in respect of which SECTION 5(f)(ii) applies, in the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Series 6 Original Issuance Date while the Convertible Preference Shares are outstanding issue Additional Class A Shares, without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price immediately prior to such issuance in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction: (1)         the numerator of which shall be (a) the number of Class A Shares Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus (b) the number of Class A Shares which the aggregate consideration received or to be received by the Corporation for the total number of Class A Shares so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (2)         the denominator of which shall be (a) the number of Class A Shares Outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus (b) the number of such Additional Class A Shares so issued.
(B)         For purposes of this SECTION 5(f)(v), the term “Additional Class A Shares” means any Class A Shares or Convertible Security (collectively, “Class A Equivalents”) issued by the Corporation after the Series 6 Original Issuance Date, provided that Additional Class A Shares will not include any of the following: (1)         Class A Equivalents issued in a transaction for which an adjustment to the Conversion Price is made pursuant to SECTION 5(f)(i), SECTION 5(f)(iii) or SECTION 5(f)(iv);    (2)         Class A Equivalents issued or issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preference Shares or Alternative Preference Shares or pursuant to the terms of any other Convertible Security issued and outstanding on the Series 6 Original Issuance Date; (3)         All Class A Shares, as adjusted for share dividends, splits, combinations and similar events, validly reserved on the Series 6 Original Issuance Date and issued or issuable upon the exercise of options or rights issued to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants, advisors or service providers to, the Corporation or any of its majority- or wholly-owned subsidiaries pursuant to any current equity incentive plans, programs or arrangements of or adopted by the Corporation, including the Corporation’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, the Corporation’s 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, the Corporation’s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the Corporation’s Amended and Restated Stock Appreciation Rights Plan; (4)         An unlimited number of Class A Equivalents issued pursuant to future equity incentive grants, plans, programs or arrangements adopted by the Corporation to the extent that any Class A Equivalents issued pursuant to this clause (4) shall not exceed three percent (3%) of the Corporation’s diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding (as calculated for the Corporation’s financial reporting purposes) in any fiscal year, with any unused amounts in any fiscal year being carried over to succeeding fiscal years; (5)         Class A Equivalents issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions of any entities, businesses and/or related assets or other business combinations by the Corporation, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or exchange of stock or otherwise, or settlement of deferred liabilities in connection therewith; or (6)         Class A Equivalents issued in a transaction with respect to which holders of a majority of the Convertible Preference Shares purchased securities pursuant to Section 4.11 of the Securities Purchase Agreement or otherwise.
Upon the expiration or forfeiture of any Additional Class A Shares consisting of options, warrants or other rights to acquire Class A Shares or Convertible Securities, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration or forfeiture of any options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of Class A Shares (and Convertible Securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities.
(vi)        Minimum Adjustment.
(vii)       When No Adjustment Required.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment to the Conversion Price need be made: (A)         for a transaction referred to in SECTION 5(f)(i) or SECTION 5(f)(ii) if the Convertible Preference Shares participate, without conversion, in the transaction or event that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to such Section at the same time as holders of the Class A Shares participate with respect to such transaction or event and on the same terms as holders of the Class A Shares participate with respect to such transaction or event as if the holders of Convertible Preference Shares, at such time, held a number of Class A Shares equal to the Conversion Amount at such time; (B)         for rights to purchase Class A Shares pursuant to any present or future plan by the Corporation for reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation’s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in Class A Shares under any plan; or (C)         for any event otherwise requiring an adjustment under this SECTION 5 if such event is not consummated.
(x)          Tax Adjustment.
(xi)         No Duplication.
(xii)        Provisions Governing Adjustment to Conversion Price.
If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the Series 6 Original Issuance Date, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof).
(xiii)       Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any adjustment of the Conversion Price or entitlement to acquire Class A Shares pursuant to these Articles of Amendment shall be subject to the rules of the Exchange to the extent required to comply with such rules.
(xiv)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Articles of Amendment, if an adjustment to the Conversion Price becomes effective on any Ex-Dividend Date as described herein, and a holder of Convertible Preference Shares that have been converted on or after such Ex-Dividend Date and on or prior to the related record date would be treated as the record holder of Class A Shares as of the related Conversion Date based on an adjusted Conversion Price for such Ex-Dividend Date, then, notwithstanding such Conversion Price adjustment provisions, the Conversion Price adjustment relating to such Ex-Dividend Date will not be made for such converted Convertible Preference Shares.
In the event of: (i)          any share split or combination of the outstanding Class A Shares; (ii)         any declaration or making of a dividend or other distribution to holders of Class A Shares in additional Class A Shares, any other share capital, other securities or other property (including, but not limited to, cash and evidences of indebtedness); (iii)        any reclassification or change to which SECTION 5(f)(i)(B) applies; (iv)        the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; or (v)         any other event constituting a Disposition Event; then the Corporation shall file with its corporate records and mail to the holders of the Convertible Preference Shares at their last addresses as shown on the records of the Corporation, at least ten (10) days prior to the record date specified in (A) below or ten (10) days prior to the date specified in (B) below, a notice stating: (A)         the record date of such share split, combination, dividend or other distribution, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Class A Shares of record to be entitled to such share split, combination, dividend or other distribution are to be determined, or    (B)         the date on which such reclassification, change, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or other event constituting a Disposition Event, is estimated to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Class A Shares of record will be entitled to exchange their Class A Shares for the share capital, other securities or other property (including, but not limited to, cash and evidences of indebtedness) deliverable upon such reclassification, change, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or other Disposition Event.
