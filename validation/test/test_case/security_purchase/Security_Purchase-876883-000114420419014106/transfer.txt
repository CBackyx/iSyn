During and following the Restricted Period, the Purchaser shall not transfer any of the Common Shares, the Preferred Shares or any Class A Shares or Alternative Preference Shares issuable or issued upon conversion of the Preferred Shares to any Purchaser Affiliate that did not execute and deliver to the Company a Joinder becoming a Purchaser party to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.
Until the Purchaser ceases to meet the Minimum Ownership Threshold, whenever the Company proposes to issue any Additional Securities that are not Excluded Securities (such proposed issuance, an “Additional Investment”), the Company will consult with the Purchaser reasonably in advance of undertaking such issuance and, if and only if the Purchaser notifies the Company within 5 Business Days following such consultation of its preliminary interest in receiving an offer to participate in such issuance (which indication shall not be binding upon the Purchaser), the Company will provide written notice of such proposed issuance to the Purchaser (an “Offer Notice”) prior to the proposed date of the purchase agreement, investment agreement or other agreement (the “Additional Investment Agreement”).
If the Purchaser elects to purchase Additional Securities in the Additional Investment specified in the Offer Notice, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company during the Participation Notice Period a written notice stating the aggregate amount of the proposed Additional Investment that the Purchaser offers to purchase, not to exceed the Purchaser’s Pro Rata Share of such Additional Investment (the “Participation Notice”).
If the Purchaser does not deliver a Participation Notice during the Participation Notice Period (or if, prior to the expiration of the Participation Notice Period, the Purchaser delivers to the Company a written notice declining to participate in the Additional Investment specified in the Offer Notice), the Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right to participate in such Additional Investment under this Section 4.11 and the Company shall thereafter be free to issue during the 60 Business Day period following the expiration of the Participation Notice Period (or the receipt by the Company of a written notice from the Purchaser declining to participate in such Additional Investment) such proposed Additional Investment to one or more third parties on terms and conditions no more favorable to any such third party than those set forth in the Offer Notice, unless otherwise agreed by the Purchaser and the Company.
If the Purchaser elects to purchase the Additional Securities pursuant to this Section 4.11, the Purchaser shall make any filings required in connection with such participation under antitrust or other applicable law promptly following the delivery to the Company of the corresponding Participation Notice and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain applicable antitrust clearance and/or approval under antitrust or other applicable laws.
During any period in which the Purchaser holds Preferred Shares, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the expiration date of any such Minimum Return Tender/Exchange Offer, the Purchaser shall (i) deliver to the depositary designated in the Minimum Return Tender/Exchange Offer all documents or instruments required to be delivered pursuant to the terms of the Minimum Return Tender/Exchange Offer and Section 14d-2 of the Exchange Act, and/or (b) instruct its broker or such other person that is the holder of record of any securities of the Company Beneficially Owned by the Purchaser to tender such securities pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Minimum Return Tender/Exchange Offer.
Such cooperation includes, but is not limited to, the Purchaser’s delivery to the Company, as requested by the Company, of such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without Canadian Withholding Tax or at a reduced rate of Canadian Withholding Tax.
In addition, the Purchaser, if requested by the Company, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will enable the Company to determine whether or not such Purchaser is subject to Canadian Withholding Tax or the amount of such Canadian Withholding Tax.
(a)          The Company will use reasonable efforts to prepare and file and use reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective or otherwise become effective pursuant to the Securities Act in each case no later than the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Target Registration Date”) a Registration Statement in order to provide for resales of Registrable Securities to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.
In order to facilitate the Company’s determination of whether to initiate a Blackout Period, the Purchaser shall give the Company notice of a proposed sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement at least two (2) Business Days (or, if two Business Days is not practicable, one (1) Business Day) prior to the proposed date of sale (which notice shall not bind the Purchaser to make any sale).
In the event of a Blackout Period, the Company shall (x) deliver to the holders of Registrable Securities a certificate signed by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or general counsel of the Company confirming that the conditions described in the definition of Blackout Period are met (but which certificate need not specify the nature of the event causing such conditions to have been met), which certificate shall contain an approximation of the anticipated delay, and (y) notify each holder of Registrable Securities promptly upon each of the commencement and the termination of each Blackout Period, which notice of termination shall be delivered to each holder of Registrable Securities no later than the close of business of the last day of the Blackout Period.
(c)          At any time that a Registration Statement is effective and prior to the Registration Termination Date, if a holder of Registrable Securities delivers a notice to the Company (a “Take-Down Notice”) stating that it intends to sell Registrable Securities with a market value of at least $25,000,000 (provided that, if Purchaser and its Affiliates do not own Registrable Securities with a market value of at least $25,000,000, they shall be permitted to deliver a Take-Down Notice to sell all of the Registrable Securities held by them (but such amount may not in any case be less than $10,000,000), in each case, pursuant to the Registration Statement, then, the Company shall amend or supplement the Registration Statement as may be necessary and to the extent required by law so that the Registration Statement remains Available in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be distributed in an Underwritten Offering (subject to Section 5.02(b)).
In connection with any Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities for which a holder delivers a Take-Down Notice and satisfies the dollar thresholds set forth in the first sentence above in this Section 5.02(c), and where the Take-Down Notice contemplates reasonable and customary marketing efforts not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours by the Company and the underwriters, the Company will use reasonable efforts to cooperate and make its senior officers available for participation in such marketing efforts (which marketing efforts will not, for the avoidance of doubt, include a “road show” requiring such officers to travel outside of the city in which they are primarily located).
The holder of Registrable Securities that delivered the applicable Take-Down Notice shall select the underwriter(s) for each Underwritten Offering.
(i)          subject to the provisions of Section 5.01(a), use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement to effect such registration in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution of such securities and thereafter use reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective pursuant to the terms of this Article V; provided, however, that the Company may discontinue any registration of its securities which are not Registrable Securities at any time prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement relating thereto; provided, further, that before filing such registration statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, including any prospectus supplements in connection with a sale referred to in a Take-Down Notice (but excluding amendments and supplements that do nothing more than name Selling Holders (as defined below) and provide information with respect thereto), the Company will furnish to the holders which are including Registrable Securities in such registration (“Selling Holders”) and the lead managing underwriter(s), if any, copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review and reasonable comment (which comments will be considered in good faith by the Company) of the counsel (if any) to such holders and counsel (if any) to such underwriter(s), and other documents reasonably requested by any such counsel, including any comment letters from the SEC, and, if requested by any such counsel, provide such counsel and the lead managing underwriter(s), if any, reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of such Registration Statement and each prospectus (including any prospectus supplement) included or deemed included therein and such other opportunities to conduct a customary and reasonable due diligence investigation (in the context of a registered underwritten offering) of the Company, including reasonable access to (including responses to any reasonable inquiries by the lead managing underwriter(s) and their counsel) the Company’s books and records, officers, accountants and other advisors, provided that the same is not disruptive to the business of the Company; provided that such persons shall first agree in writing with the Company that any information that is reasonably designated by the Company as confidential at the time of delivery shall be kept confidential by such persons subject to customary exceptions;
(iv)        furnish to the Selling Holders and each underwriter, if any, of the securities being sold by such Selling Holders such number of conformed copies of such Registration Statement and of each amendment and supplement thereto, such number of copies of the prospectus and any prospectus supplement contained in or deemed part of such Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus supplement) and each free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) (a “Free Writing Prospectus”) utilized in connection therewith and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as such Selling Holders and underwriter(s), if any, may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Selling Holders;
(vii)       as promptly as practicable notify in writing the holders of Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, of the following events: (A) the filing of the Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, the prospectus or any prospectus supplement related thereto or post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or any Free Writing Prospectus utilized in connection therewith, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective; (B) any request by the SEC or any other U.S. or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or the prospectus; (C) the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings by any person for that purpose; (D) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or “blue sky” laws of any jurisdiction or the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose; (E) if at any time the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) related to such registration cease to be true and correct in any material respect; and (F) upon the happening of any event that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect, or that requires the making of any changes in such registration statement, prospectus or documents so that, in the case of such Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, in the case of clause (F), that such notice need not include the nature or details concerning such event;
(xi)         use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates or book-entry securities representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to the Registration Statements, which certificates or book-entry securities shall be free, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any such holders may request in writing; and in connection therewith, if required by the Company’s transfer agent, the Company will promptly after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement cause to be delivered to its transfer agent when and as required by such transfer agent from time to time, any authorizations, certificates, directions and other evidence required by the transfer agent which authorize and direct the transfer agent to issue such Registrable Securities without legends upon sale by the holder of such shares of Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement; and
(xii)        agrees with each holder of Registrable Securities that, in connection with any Underwritten Offering or other resale pursuant to the Registration Statement in accordance with the terms hereof, it will use reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith and execute all customary indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements (in each case on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company), including using reasonable efforts to procure customary legal opinions, including a 10b-5 letter, and auditor “comfort” letters, and shall furnish to the Purchaser upon its request such documents.
(b)          The Company may require each Selling Holder and each underwriter, if any, to (i) furnish the Company in writing such information regarding each Selling Holder or underwriter and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing to complete or amend the information required by such Registration Statement and/or any other documents relating to such registered offering, and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause the execution and delivery of, and to perform under, or cause the performance under, any agreements and instruments reasonably requested by the Company to effectuate such registered offering, including, without limitation, opinions of counsel and questionnaires.
(d)          In any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified party, the indemnified party shall promptly notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and acknowledging the obligations of the indemnifying party with respect to such proceeding, the indemnifying party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, supervision and monitoring (unless (i) such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying party or a conflict of interest otherwise exists or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed within a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and the indemnified party is or would reasonably be expected to be materially prejudiced by such delay, in either event the indemnified party shall be promptly reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the expenses incurred in connection with retaining one separate legal counsel (for the avoidance of doubt, for all indemnified parties in connection therewith)).
The Purchaser shall have the right, at any time and from time to time when no Purchaser Affiliated Director is serving on the Board of Directors (including after receiving information regarding any potential public offering), to elect to not receive any Piggyback Notice or any notice of a Blackout Period that the Company otherwise is required to deliver pursuant to this Agreement by delivering to the Company a written statement signed by the Purchaser that it does not want to receive any such notices hereunder (an “Opt-Out Request”); in which case and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement the Company shall not be required to, and shall not, deliver any such notice or other information required to be provided to the Purchaser hereunder to the extent that the Company reasonably expects would result in the Purchaser acquiring material non-public information within the meaning of Regulation FD promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 1.
Dividends.
SECTION 2.
Notice of any such original meeting of the holders of the Convertible Preference Shares shall be given not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed for such meeting and shall specify in general terms the purpose for which the meeting is called, and notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) days prior to the date fixed for such adjourned meeting, but it shall not be necessary to specify in such notice the purpose for which the adjourned meeting is called.
In order to convert the Convertible Preference Shares into Class A Shares, the holder must surrender the certificates representing such Convertible Preference Shares, accompanied by transfer instruments satisfactory to the Corporation, free of any adverse interest or liens at the office of the Corporation’s transfer agent for the Convertible Preference Shares, together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or such number of shares represented by such certificates as specified therein.
With respect to a conversion pursuant to this SECTION 5(a), the date of receipt of such certificates, together with such notice and such other information or documents as may be required by the Corporation (including any certificates delivered pursuant to SECTION 5(b)), by the transfer agent or the Corporation will be the date of conversion (the “Conversion Date”) and the Conversion Date with respect to a conversion pursuant to SECTION 5(c) will be as provided in such section.
Upon the written request of the holder, the Corporation shall within two (2) Business Days confirm in writing (which may be by email) to any holder the number of Class A Shares and Class B Shares then outstanding.
In connection with any conversion and as a condition to the Corporation effecting such conversion, upon request of the Corporation, a holder of Convertible Preference Shares shall deliver to the Corporation a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer of such holder, no less than twelve (12) Business Days prior to the applicable conversion, certifying that, after giving effect to such conversion, (i) such holder’s aggregate voting power on a matter being voted on by holders of Class A Shares will not exceed 19.9% of the Maximum Voting Power or (ii) such holder will not Beneficially Own more than 19.9% of the then outstanding Common Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of Convertible Preference Shares shall continue to have the right to convert their Convertible Preference Shares pursuant to SECTION 5(a) until and through the Conversion Date contemplated in this SECTION 5(c) and if such Convertible Preference Shares are converted pursuant to SECTION 5(a) such shares shall no longer be converted pursuant to this SECTION 5(c) and the Corporation’s notice delivered to the holders pursuant to this SECTION 5(c) shall be of no effect with respect to such shares converted pursuant to SECTION 5(a).
(i)          Promptly after the Conversion Date (and in any event within three (3) Business Days), the Corporation shall (A) issue and deliver to such holder the number of Class A Shares to which such holder is entitled in exchange for the certificates formerly representing Convertible Preference Shares and (B) pay to such holder, to the extent of funds legally available therefor, all declared and unpaid Dividends on the Convertible Preference Shares that are being converted into Class A Shares; provided, that any accrued and unpaid Dividends not paid to such holder pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall, subject to SECTION 5(b), be converted into a number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Class A Shares equal to the number determined by dividing (x) the aggregate amount of such accrued and unpaid Dividends on the Convertible Preference Shares that are being converted by (y) the then current Conversion Price.
To the extent that Class A Shares are not delivered pursuant to such rights, options or warrants or upon the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of Class A Shares actually delivered.
(viii)      Rules of Calculation; Treasury Shares.
(ix)         Waiver.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price will not be reduced if the Corporation receives, prior to the effective time of the adjustment to the Conversion Price, written notice from the holders representing at least a majority of the then outstanding Convertible Preference Shares, voting together as a separate class, that no adjustment is to be made as the result of a particular issuance of Class A Shares or other dividend or other distribution on Class A Shares.
(g)          Notice of Record Date.
(h)          Certificate of Adjustments.
Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this SECTION 5, the Corporation shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Convertible Preference Shares a certificate, signed by an officer of the Corporation, setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
The Corporation shall, upon the reasonable written request of any holder of Convertible Preference Shares, furnish to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) the calculation of such adjustments and readjustments in reasonable detail, (ii) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (iii) the number of Class A Shares and the amount, if any, of share capital, other securities or other property (including, but not limited to, cash and evidences of indebtedness) which then would be received upon the conversion of Convertible Preference Shares.
(ii)         If the Corporation elects to redeem the Convertible Preference Shares pursuant to this SECTION 6, on or prior to the fifteenth (15th) Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption Date, the Corporation shall mail a written notice of redemption (the “Redemption Notice”) by first-class mail addressed to the holders of record of the Convertible Preference Shares as they appear in the records of the Corporation; provided, however, that accidental failure to give any such notice to one or more of such holders shall not affect the validity of such redemption.
The Redemption Notice must state: (A) the expected Redemption Price as of the expected Redemption Date, and specify the individual components thereof (it being understood that the actual Redemption Price will be determined as of the actual Redemption Date); (B) the name of the redemption agent to whom, and the address of the place to where, the Convertible Preference Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; (C) if applicable, that the consummation of the Redemption and the payment of the Redemption Price shall be subject to the consummation of the Specified Event, and (D) the anticipated Redemption Date.
(i)          On the Redemption Date, the Corporation shall pay the applicable Redemption Price, upon surrender of the certificates representing the Convertible Preference Shares to be redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require, and letters of transmittal and instructions therefor on reasonable terms are included in the notice sent by the Corporation); provided that payment of the Redemption Price for certificates (and accompanying documentation, if required) surrendered to the Corporation after 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date may, at the Corporation’s option, be made on the Business Day immediately following the Redemption Date.
(a)          If (i) the Corporation validly delivers a notice of conversion pursuant to SECTION 5(c) to the Investor or any Permitted Transferee at any time on and after the two (2) year anniversary of the Series 6 Original Issuance Date and (ii) the Investor or such Permitted Transferee would not be permitted to convert one or more of its Beneficially Owned Convertible Preference Shares into Class A Shares because any applicable waiting period has not lapsed, or approval has not been obtained, under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or other applicable law, the Accretion Rate will decrease to 0% per annum following, and the Base Liquidation Preference per Convertible Preference Share will not increase during any period subsequent to, ten (10) Business Days following the date of such validly delivered notice (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not be earlier than the two (2) year anniversary of the Series 6 Original Issuance Date).
(d)          As soon as practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after receipt of notice of either of the events described in SECTION 7(c), which notice shall include the amount of Alternative Preference Shares to which such holder is entitled and the basis for such conversion into Alternative Preference Shares, the Corporation shall (i) issue and deliver to such holder a certificate for the number of Alternative Preference Shares, if any, to which such holder is entitled in exchange for the certificates formerly representing the Convertible Preference Shares and (ii) pay to such holder, to the extent of funds legally available therefor, all declared and unpaid Dividends on the Convertible Preference Shares that are being converted into Alternative Preference Shares.
Miscellaneous.
(b)          Wire or Electronic Transfer of Funds.
As soon as practicable following the determination by the Corporation that a payment is to be made by way of a wire or electronic transfer of funds, the Corporation shall provide a notice to the applicable registered holders of Convertible Preference Shares at their respective addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation.
Such notice shall request that each applicable registered holder of Convertible Preference Shares provide the particulars of an account of such holder with a chartered bank in the United States to which the wire or electronic transfer of funds shall be directed.
(d)          U.S. Currency.

Notice of any such original meeting of the holders of the Convertible Preference Shares shall be given not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed for such meeting and shall specify in general terms the purpose for which the meeting is called, and notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) days prior to the date fixed for such adjourned meeting, but it shall not be necessary to specify in such notice the purpose for which the adjourned meeting is called.
In order to convert the Convertible Preference Shares into Class A Shares, the holder must surrender the certificates representing such Convertible Preference Shares, accompanied by transfer instruments satisfactory to the Corporation, free of any adverse interest or liens at the office of the Corporation’s transfer agent for the Convertible Preference Shares, together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or such number of shares represented by such certificates as specified therein.
With respect to a conversion pursuant to this SECTION 5(a), the date of receipt of such certificates, together with such notice and such other information or documents as may be required by the Corporation (including any certificates delivered pursuant to SECTION 5(b)), by the transfer agent or the Corporation will be the date of conversion (the “Conversion Date”).
Upon the written request of the holder, the Corporation shall within two (2) Business Days confirm in writing (which may be by email) to any holder the number of Class A Shares and Class B Shares then outstanding.
In connection with any conversion and as a condition to the Corporation effecting such conversion, upon request of the Corporation, a holder of Convertible Preference Shares shall deliver to the Corporation a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer of such holder, no less than twelve (12) Business Days prior to the applicable conversion, certifying that, after giving effect to such conversion, (i) such holder’s aggregate voting power on a matter being voted on by holders of Class A Shares will not exceed 19.9% of the Maximum Voting Power or (ii) such holder will not Beneficially Own more than 19.9% of the then outstanding Common Shares.
(i)          Promptly after the Conversion Date (and in any event within three (3) Business Days), the Corporation shall (A) issue and deliver to such holder the number of Class A Shares to which such holder is entitled in exchange for the certificates formerly representing Convertible Preference Shares and (B) pay to such holder, to the extent of funds legally available therefor, all declared and unpaid Participating Dividends on the Convertible Preference Shares that are being converted into Class A Shares.
To the extent that Class A Shares are not delivered pursuant to such rights, options or warrants or upon the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Amount shall be readjusted to the Conversion Amount that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of Class A Shares actually delivered.
(vii)       Rules of Calculation; Treasury Shares.
(viii)      Waiver.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Amount will not be reduced if the Corporation receives, prior to the effective time of the adjustment to the Conversion Amount, written notice from the holders representing at least a majority of the then outstanding Convertible Preference Shares, voting together as a separate class, that no adjustment is to be made as the result of a particular issuance of Class A Shares or other dividend or other distribution on Class A Shares.
(g)          Notice of Record Date.
(h)          Certificate of Adjustments.
Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Amount pursuant to this SECTION 5, the Corporation shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Convertible Preference Shares a certificate, signed by an officer of the Corporation, setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
The Corporation shall, upon the reasonable written request of any holder of Convertible Preference Shares, furnish to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) the calculation of such adjustments and readjustments in reasonable detail, (ii) the Conversion Amount then in effect, and (iii) the number of Class A Shares and the amount, if any, of share capital, other securities or other property (including, but not limited to, cash and evidences of indebtedness) which then would be received upon the conversion of Convertible Preference Shares.
Miscellaneous.
(b)          Wire or Electronic Transfer of Funds.
As soon as practicable following the determination by the Corporation that a payment is to be made by way of a wire or electronic transfer of funds, the Corporation shall provide a notice to the applicable registered holders of Convertible Preference Shares at their respective addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation.
Such notice shall request that each applicable registered holder of Convertible Preference Shares provide the particulars of an account of such holder with a chartered bank in the United States to which the wire or electronic transfer of funds shall be directed.
