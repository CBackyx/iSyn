Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.
The number of Conversion Shares to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Notice of Conversion”), delivered to the Borrower or Borrower’s transfer agent by the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower or Borrower’s transfer agent before 11:59 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the “Conversion Date”).
The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Conversion Shares or instructions to have the Conversion Shares issued as contemplated by Section 1.4(f) hereof, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates or cause the Company to electronically issue shares of Common Stock to execute and issue the necessary certificates for the Conversion Shares or cause the Conversion Shares to be issued as contemplated by Section 1.4(f) hereof in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note.

Nothing shall limit the Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver certificates representing the Conversion Shares (or to electronically deliver such Conversion Shares) upon the conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof.

4.10 Remedies.
So long as this Note is outstanding, upon any issuance by the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries of any security, or amendment to a security that was originally issued before the Issue Date, with any term that the Holder reasonably believes is more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that the Holder reasonably believes was not similarly provided to the Holder in this Note, then (i) the Borrower shall notify the Holder of such additional or more favorable term within one (1) business day of the issuance and/or amendment (as applicable) of the respective security, and (ii) such term, at Holder’s option, shall become a part of the transaction documents with the Holder (regardless of whether the Borrower complied with the notification provision of this Section 4.14).
If the Holder and the Borrower are unable to agree upon such determination or calculation within one (1) Trading Day of such disputed determination or arithmetic calculation (as the case may be) being submitted to the Borrower or the Holder, then the Borrower shall, within one (1) Trading Day, submit (a) the disputed determination of the Conversion Price, the closing bid price, the or fair market value (as the case may be) to an independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Borrower and approved by the Holder or (b) the disputed arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Price, Conversion Amount, any prepayment amount or Default Amount, to an independent, outside accountant selected by the Holder that is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.
The Borrower shall cause at its expense the investment bank or the accountant to perform the determinations or calculations and notify the Borrower and the Holder of the results no later than one (1) Trading Day from the time it receives such disputed determinations or calculations.
Box Checked as to applicable instructions:  The undersigned hereby requests that the Borrower issue a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock set forth below (which numbers are based on the Holder’s calculation attached hereto) in the name(s) specified immediately below or, if additional space is necessary, on an attachment hereto:
Registration.
a. Piggy-Back Registration.
The payment of liquidated damages shall not relieve the Company from its obligations to register the Piggy-Back Registrable Securities and deliver the Piggy-Back Registrable Securities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement.
c The Company shall furnish to the Holder whose Piggy-Back Registrable Securities are included in any Registration Statement and its legal counsel without charge and upon request (i) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC at least one copy of such Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits, the prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and, with regards to such Registration Statement(s), any correspondence by or on behalf of the Company to the SEC or the staff of the SEC and any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its representatives, (ii) upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, a copy of the prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto (or such other number of copies as the Holder may reasonably request) and (iii) such other documents, including copies of any preliminary or final prospectus, as the Holder may reasonably request from time to time in order to facilitate the disposition of the Piggy-Back Registrable Securities.
The Company filing the documents described in this paragraph through EDGAR shall constitute delivery.
The Company shall promptly notify the Holder who holds Piggy-Back Registrable Securities of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any of the Piggy-Back Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or “blue sky” laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
e. Upon the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, would then contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact, which would otherwise be required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and, as a result, the prospectus is required to be supplemented or as a result of which the Registration Statement is required to be amended (“Registration Default”), the Company shall use all diligent efforts to promptly prepare any necessary supplement to such prospectus or amendment to such Registration Statement and take any other necessary steps to cure the Registration Default, and deliver one (1) copy of such supplement or amendment to Holder (or such other number of copies as Holder may reasonably request; delivery via EDGAR shall constitute delivery).
The Company shall also promptly notify Holder in writing (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to Holder by facsimile on the same day of such effectiveness and by overnight mail); (ii) in the event the Registration Statement is no longer effective; or (iii) the Registration Statement is stale for a period of more than five (5) trading days as a result of the Company’s failure to timely file its financials with the SEC.
