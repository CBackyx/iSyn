     “Premium Redemption Price” shall mean          (a) as to the Warrant Shares, 120% of the dollar amount which is the product of (i) the number of shares to be redeemed, and (ii) the Per Share Market Value for shares of Common Stock in existence at the time (x) of the closing of a redemption of the Warrant Shares or (y) of the event triggering the right to redemption, whichever results in a greater Premium Redemption Price.
(b) as to the Warrants, 120% of the dollar amount which is the product of (i) the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder upon exercise of Warrants, and (ii) the Per Share Market Value for shares of Common Stock in existence at the time (x) of the closing of a redemption of the Warrants or (y) the event triggering the right of redemption, whichever results in a greater Redemption Price.
(A) In the event that the Registration Statement has not been filed by the Filing Deadline or been declared effective by the Effectiveness Deadline, then the Company shall pay in cash or shares of Common Stock, as provided in Section 2(b)(v), to each Holder a Delay Payment for each 30 day period (or portion thereof) thereafter until the earliest of (i) the date on which a Holder’s Warrants have been redeemed pursuant to its delivery of a Put Notice (as defined below) (with respect to that Holder only), and (ii) the date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective, which Delay Payments shall not in the aggregate exceed the maximum percentage permitted by law.

(A) All Delay Payments (which payments shall be pro rata on a per diem basis for any period of less than 30 days) required to be made in connection
Such Delay Payments shall be payable in cash.
(vi)  Premium Price Redemption for Delay Payment Defaults.

Each Delay Payment triggered by an Interfering Event provided for in the foregoing paragraphs (ii) through (iv) shall be in addition to each other Delay Payment triggered by another Interfering Event; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay to any Holder Delay Payments in an aggregate amount greater than one Delay Payment for any 30-day period (or portion thereof).
