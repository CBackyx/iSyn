(b)                                 Limitations on Requested Registration.
The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any such registration pursuant to this Section 2.1:
(ii)           In any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification, or compliance, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act;
(iii)          After the Company has initiated two (2) such registrations pursuant to this Section 2.1 (counting for these purposes only (1) registrations where at least 75% of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered are in
5
fact registered and which have been declared or ordered effective and pursuant to which securities have been sold, and (2) registrations that closed, or were withdrawn at the request of the Holders (other than as a result of a material adverse change to the Company)); or
(c)                                  Deferral.
If (i) in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, the filing of a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities would be materially detrimental to the Company and the Board of Directors concludes, as a result, that it is in the best interests of the Company to defer the filing of such registration statement at such time, and (ii) the Company shall furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the President of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, it would be materially detrimental to the Company for such registration statement to be filed in the near future and that it is, therefore, in the best interests of the Company to defer the filing of such registration statement, then (in addition to the limitations set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iv) above) the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the Initiating Holders, and, provided further, that the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than twice in any twelve (12)-month period.
(d)                                 Underwriting.
In such event, the right of any Holder to include all or any portion of its Registrable Securities in a registration pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities to the extent provided herein.
If the Company shall request inclusion in any registration pursuant to this Section 2.1 of securities being sold for its own account, or if other persons shall request inclusion in any registration pursuant to this Section 2.1, the Initiating Holders shall, on behalf of all Holders, offer to include such securities in the underwriting and such offer shall be conditioned upon the participation of the Company or such other persons in such underwriting and the inclusion of the Company’s and such person’s other securities of the Company and their acceptance of the further applicable provisions of this Section 2 (including Section 2.10).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.1, if the underwriters advise the Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the number of Registrable Securities that may be so included shall be apportioned pro rata among the selling Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all selling Holders or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders.
In no event shall Registrable Securities be excluded from such registration unless all other stockholders’ securities and securities for the account of the Company have been first excluded.
If a person who has requested inclusion in such registration as provided above does not agree to the terms of any such underwriting, such person shall be excluded therefrom by written notice from the Company, the underwriter or the Initiating Holders.
The securities so excluded shall also be withdrawn from registration.
Any Registrable Securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall also be withdrawn from such registration.
If shares are so withdrawn from the registration and if the number of shares to be included in such registration was previously reduced as a result of marketing factors pursuant to this Section 2.1(d), then the Company shall then offer to all Holders who have retained rights to include securities in the registration the right to include additional Registrable Securities in the registration in an aggregate amount equal to the number of shares so withdrawn, with such shares to be allocated among such Holders requesting additional inclusion, as set forth above.
2.2                            Piggyback Registration.
(a)                                 Piggyback Registration.
If the Company shall determine to register any of its securities either for its own account or the account of a security holder or holders, other than a registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.3, a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt securities, a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or other Rule 145 transaction, or a registration on any registration form that does not permit secondary sales, the Company will:
(ii)           use its commercially reasonable efforts to include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance), except as set forth in Section 2.2(b) below, and in any underwriting involved therein, all of such Registrable Securities as are specified in a written request or requests made by any Holder or Holders received by the Company within twenty (20) days after such written notice from the Company is mailed or delivered.
7
(b)                                 Underwriting.
If the registration of which the Company gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the Company shall so advise the Holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i).
In such event, the right of any Holder to registration pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein.
All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the Company and the other holders of securities of the Company with registration rights to participate therein distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected by the Company.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.2, if the underwriters advise the Company in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the underwriters may (subject to the limitations set forth below) limit the number of Registrable Securities to be included in the registration and underwriting.
In no event shall any Registrable Securities be excluded from such registration and underwriting unless all other stockholders’ securities have been first excluded.
In the event that the underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered can be included in such registration and underwriting, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such registration and underwriting shall be apportioned pro rata among the selling Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all selling Holders or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the amount of securities of the selling Holders included in the registration and underwriting be reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total amount of securities requested to be included in such registration and underwriting, unless such registration is the Company’s Initial Public Offering, in which case the selling Holders may be excluded if the underwriters make the determination described above.
If a person who has requested inclusion in such registration as provided above does not agree to the terms of any such underwriting, such person shall also be excluded therefrom by written notice from the Company or the underwriter.
The securities so excluded shall also be withdrawn from such registration.
Any Registrable Securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration.

(a)                                 Request for Form S-3 Registration.
If the Company is then qualified for the use of Form S-3, in addition to the rights contained in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2 and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.3, and shall receive from Initiating Holders a written request signed by such Initiating Holder(s) that the Company effect any registration on Form S-3 or any similar short form
8
registration statement with respect to all or part of the Registrable Securities (such request shall state the number of shares of Registrable Securities requested to be disposed of and the intended methods of disposition of such shares by such Holder or Holders), the Company will take all such actions with respect to such Registrable Securities as required by Section 2.1(a)(i) and (ii); provided that in the case of a registration pursuant to this Section 2.3, the Company also shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the registration statement within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the request from the Initiating Holders.
(b)                                 Limitations on Form S-3 Registration.
The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or take any action to effect, any such registration pursuant to this Section 2.3:
(i)            In the circumstances described in either Sections 2.1(b)(ii) or 2.1(b)(iv);
(iii)          If, in a given twelve (12)-month period, the Company has effected two (2) such registrations in such period that have been declared effective by the SEC.
(c)                                  Deferral.
The provisions of Section 2.1(c) shall apply to any registration pursuant to this Section 2.3.
(d)                                 Underwriting.
If the Initiating Holders requesting registration under this Section 2.3 intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, the provisions of Sections 2.1(d) shall apply to such registration.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall not be counted as requests for registration or registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.1.
2.4                            Expenses of Registration.
All Registration Expenses incurred in connection with registrations pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 hereof shall be borne by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.3 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered (in which case all participating Holders shall bear such expenses pro rata among each other based on the number of Registrable Securities requested to be so registered), unless the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities agree to forfeit their right to a demand registration pursuant to Section 2.1; and provided further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the Holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of the Company from that known to the Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness following disclosure by the Company of, or
9
their learning of, such material adverse change, then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.3, as the case may be.
All Selling Expenses shall be borne pro rata by the selling Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities requested to be so registered.
2.5                            Registration Procedures.
At its expense, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to:
(a)                                 Keep such registration effective for a period ending on the earlier of the date which is nine (9) months from the effective date of the registration statement or such time as the Holder or Holders have completed the distribution described in the registration statement relating thereto;
(b)                                 Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement for the period set forth in subsection (a) above;
(c)                                  Furnish such number of prospectuses, including any preliminary prospectuses, and other documents incident thereto, including any amendment of or supplement to the prospectus, as a Holder from time to time may reasonably request;

12
No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.
Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.
(d)                                 If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.6 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to herein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that no contribution by any Holder, when combined with any amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to Section 2.6(b), shall exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder.
The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in
13
