NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: ARTICLE I.ADOPTION OF AGREEMENT  Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 herein), in accordance with this the relevant provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Target, and Target shall be the surviving corporation to the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”).
 Following the Merger, Target shall continue to exist under and be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and shall be the Surviving Corporation.
At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Target and the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Target and the Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.
The Certificate of Incorporation of Target, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall continue in full force and effect, and shall be adopted as the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.
The By-laws of Target, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall continue in full force and effect, and shall be adopted as the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.
The directors of Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.
All such converted shares of Target Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such converted shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing that number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into which such shares of Target Common Stock were converted in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement.
At the Effective Time, all unexercised and unexpired options to purchase shares of Target Common Stock then outstanding under any stock option plan of Target at the Effective Time, including the 2004 Equity Incentive Awards Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the “Target Stock Option Plans”), whether or not then exercisable (the “Target Options”), shall be assumed by Orion.
The conversion of any Target Options which are “incentive stock options” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code into options to purchase Orion Common Stock shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code so as not to constitute a “modification” of such Target Options within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code.

No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates, and no dividend or distribution with respect to Series B Preferred Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Orion.
Orion shall retain and reserve that number of authorized but unissued shares of Orion Common Stock that shall be issuable upon the exercise of the Target Warrants and the Target Options at any given time until their respective exercise, conversion or termination, as applicable.

Such holder shall be entitled to receive only such rights as are granted under Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CCC, as applicable.
If any such holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or loses such dissenters’ rights under the DGCL or the CCC, as applicable, such Target Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive that number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock to which such shares of Target securities are entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE II, in each case without interest.

Upon the surrender by Participating Stockholders of each certificate representing shares of Target Common Stock, and upon the issuance and delivery by Orion of certificates representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the certificates which prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Target Common Stock shall forthwith be canceled.
Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such certificate representing shares of Target Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only a right to receive shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and the holders of such certificates after the Effective Time shall no longer be deemed for any purpose to be holders of shares of Target Common Stock.
(b) Participating Stockholders shall, for all purposes (except for the payment of possible dividends or other distributions by Orion which shall be withheld until the exchange of certificates pursuant to Section 2.4(a) hereof), be deemed to be stockholders of Orion, as of the Effective Time, irrespective of whether they have received their certificates or agreements representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

It is agreed that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such losses, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(b) Indemnification by the Medivation Stockholder.
Each Medivation Stockholder agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors, officers, employees, stockholders and each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the 1933 Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expense (including reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any FORM OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT
untrue statement of a material fact or any omission of a material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in writing by such Medivation Stockholder to the Company specifically for inclusion in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto.
In no event shall the liability of a Medivation Stockholder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of all expense paid by such Medivation Stockholder in connection with any claim relating to this Section 6 and the amount of any damages such Medivation Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission) received by such Medivation Stockholder upon the sale of the Medivation Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation.
It is agreed that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such losses, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the affected Medivation Stockholder(s) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings.
Any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (b) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person or (c) in the reasonable judgment of any such person, based upon written advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest exists between such person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such person); and provided, further, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or litigation.
It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for fees or expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such indemnified parties.
No indemnifying party will, except with the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.
(d) Contribution.
If for any reason the indemnification provided for in the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient to hold it harmless, other than as expressly specified therein, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the FORM OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT
indemnified party and the indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act shall be entitled to contribution from any person not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
In no event shall the contribution obligation of a holder of Registrable Securities be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of all expenses paid by such holder in connection with any claim relating to this Section 6 and the amount of any damages such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission) received by it upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation.
