The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Initial Purchaser be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Initial Purchaser with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by 21
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

We express no opinion on the priority of any security interest.J.

(2) Such opinion is limited to the creation and perfection of security interests in the Article 9 Collateral and such opinion does not address the creation or perfection of security interests in any other assets.
We express no opinion as to the priority of any security interest in any assets (including the Article 9 Collateral).

(4) To the extent that such opinion covers proceeds, such opinion is limited by Sections 9-315 and 9-322 of the NY-UCC.
(5) We note that Section 552 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”), limits the extent to which property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code is subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by the debtor before such commencement.

(8) (i) We have relied on the representations of the Escrow Agent as to the absence of any other agreements establishing “control” over the Escrow Account, (ii) we note that the security interest of the Trustee in the Escrow Account will be subordinate to any security interest now or hereafter created therein in favor of the Escrow Agent and (iii) we express no opinion as to the impact of Section 4 of the Escrow Agreement on the Trustee’s control over the Escrow Account.
(9) We also call to your attention that, under the NY-UCC, actions taken by the Escrow Agent, including amending the Escrow Agreement in a manner which eliminates or shares the “control” of the Trustee over the Escrow Account subject thereto, may adversely affect the security interest of the Trustee.J.
Whenever a statement or opinion herein is qualified by “no facts have come to our attention” or a similar phrase, it means that the lawyers currently practicing law with this Firm who have been actively involved in representing the Company in connection with the transactions described in the first paragraph of this letter, after consultation with such other attorneys currently practicing law with this Firm as they considered appropriate, have no actual current awareness of the inaccuracy of any such statement or opinion, and no inference as to our knowledge or that we have any knowledge of any matters pertaining to such statement or opinion should be drawn from the fact that we have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.The opinions expressed and the statements made herein are expressed and made as of the time of closing of the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers on the date hereof and we assume no obligation to advise you of changes in law, fact or other circumstances (or the effect thereof on such opinions or statements) that may come to our attention after such time.This letter is rendered solely to and for the benefit of the Initial Purchasers in connection with the transaction described in the first paragraph above and may not be quoted to or relied upon by, nor may this letter or copies hereof be delivered to, any other person (including, without limitation, any person who acquires Notes from or through any Initial Purchaser), nor may this letter be used for any other purpose, without our prior written consent.Very truly yours, Annex D-1-9

This clause (xi) shall not apply to any filing by the Company or the Guarantors of any Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K with respect to matters unrelated to the Exchange Offer or the Registrable Securities and the offering thereof or exchange therefor;(xii) obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, not later than the initial effective date of a Registration Statement;(xiii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be; cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and execute, and use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;(xiv) if reasonably requested by any Participating Holder, promptly include in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Participating Holder as such Participating Holder reasonably requests to be included therein, based on a reasonable belief that such information is required to be included therein or is necessary to make the information about such Participating Holder therein not misleading, and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt by the Company of written notification of the matters to be so included in such filing;(xv) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all such other actions in connection therewith (including those requested by the Participating Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (1) to the extent possible, make such representations and warranties to the Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Registration Statement, Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and consistent with the applicable representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement and confirm the same if and when requested; provided that the Participating Holders’ representations and warranties shall be of the substance and scope as are customarily made by selling securityholders to underwriters and issuers in underwritten offerings, (2) use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and the Guarantors (which opinions, in form, scope and Exhibit B-12
substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and consistent with the opinions delivered pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; provided that, if required by the Underwriter, counsel for the Participating Holders shall provide an opinion to the Underwriter covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested from selling securityholders by underwriters in underwritten offerings, (3) use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain “comfort” letters from the independent registered public accountants of the Company and the Guarantors (and, if necessary, any other registered public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company or any Guarantor, or of any business acquired by the Company or any Guarantor for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each Participating Holder (to the extent permitted by applicable professional standards) and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in “comfort” letters in connection with underwritten offerings, including but not limited to financial information contained in any preliminary prospectus, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus and (4) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold or by the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors made pursuant to clause (1) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement; and(xvi) so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding, cause each Additional Guarantor upon the creation or acquisition by the Company of such Additional Guarantor, to execute a counterpart to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Annex A and to deliver such counterpart to the Initial Purchasers no later than five Business Days following the execution thereof.
No Holder of Registrable Securities shall be entitled to include any of its Registrable Securities in any Shelf Registration pursuant to this Agreement unless such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing, promptly (but in no event later than 10 days) following receipt of a written request therefor, such information as the Company may reasonably request for inclusion in any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus included therein about such Holder required to be disclosed so that the information about such Holder disclosed is not materially misleading and does not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and no such Holder shall be entitled to Additional Interest pursuant hereto unless and until such Holder shall have provided such information.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may postpone effecting a Shelf Registration (or the maintenance of its effectiveness and usability) or may suspend the usability of the Prospectus relating to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement if (i) an event occurs and is continuing as a result of which the Shelf Registration, any related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, would, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Company, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading (with respect to such a Prospectus only, in light of the circumstances under which they were made), and (ii) (a) the board of directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment that the disclosure of such event at such time would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or prospects of the Company, (b) the disclosure otherwise relates to a pending material business transaction that has not yet been publicly disclosed or (c) the board of directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment that some other valid business purpose exists for not making such disclosure at such time; provided, however, that the Company may only suspend the offering and sale of Securities under a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this clause (ii) for a period or periods not in excess of 60 consecutive days or more than two (2) times during any calendar year during which such Shelf Registration Statement is required to be effective and usable hereunder (measured from the effective time of such Shelf Registration Statement to successive anniversaries thereof).
In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager or managers (each an “Underwriter”) that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering, subject in each case to consent by the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such bank or manager is nationally recognized as an underwriter of debt securities offerings).
(f) Each Holder agrees that such Holder shall not take any action that would result in the Company or Guarantors being required to file with the SEC a free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405, as amended, under the Securities Act, prepared by or on behalf of such Holder that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company or Guarantors thereunder, but for the action of such Holder.
No Holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any Underwritten Offering hereunder unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell such Holder’s Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.4.
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer.
(a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a “Participating Broker-Dealer”) may be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Exhibit B-14
The Company and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staff’s position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b) In light of the above, and subject to Section 3(d), the Company and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to include the necessary plan of distribution and related disclosure for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above.
The Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized, subject to Section 3(d), to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof.5.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any “issuer information” (“Issuer Information”) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through J.P. Morgan or any selling Holder, respectively, expressly for use therein.
In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
Exhibit B-15
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the “Indemnified Person”) shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the “Indemnifying Person”) in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above.
If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.
In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.
It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one local counsel per relevant jurisdiction) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reasonable and documented and shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.
The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
practicable under the terms of such settlement and in any event at least 5 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.
The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The Holders’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
