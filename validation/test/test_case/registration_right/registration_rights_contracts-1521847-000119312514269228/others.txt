(b) Indemnification by the Initial Purchasers.
Each Initial Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Memorial Parties, their respective directors and each person, if any, who controls the Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, 28

(c) Actions Against Parties; Notification.
Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder; provided, however, that the failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 or otherwise.
Counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected as follows: counsel to the Initial Purchasers and the other indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(a) above shall be selected by the Representative; and counsel to the Memorial Parties, their respective directors, each of their respective officers and each person, if any, who controls the Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall be selected by the Partnership.
An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party.
In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Initial Purchasers and the other indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(a) above; and the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Memorial Parties, their respective directors, each of their respective officers and each person, if any, who controls the Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, in each case in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
29
If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 6, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.SECTION 7.
Contribution.
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and of the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.The relative benefits received by the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Memorial Parties and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as determined pursuant to this Agreement, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Offering Memorandum.The relative fault of the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, or by the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.The Memorial Parties and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.
The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal 30
or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds from the sale to Eligible Purchasers of the Securities initially purchased by it exceed the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.For purposes of this Section 7, each affiliate, officer, director, employee, partner and member of each Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each director of each of the Memorial Parties, each officer of each of the Memorial Parties, and each person, if any, who controls the Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Memorial Parties.
The Initial Purchasers’ respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Exhibit A hereto and not joint.SECTION 8.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
All the respective representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Memorial Parties and the Initial Purchasers shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or the Memorial Parties, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.SECTION 9.
Termination of Agreement.

Such identification is for the limited purpose of making the statements set forth in this letter and is not the expression of a view by us as to whether any such information has been or should have been conveyed to investors generally or to any particular investors at any particular time or in any particular manner.
Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters, financial, accounting or statistical information or reserve and production information, and because many determinations involved in the preparation of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum are of a wholly or partially non-legal character, except as expressly set forth in paragraph 8 of this opinion letter, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements.However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Partnership in connection with the preparation of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum, we have reviewed each such document and have participated in conferences and telephone conversations with representatives of the Partnership, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Partnership, representatives of the independent reserve engineers for the applicable Specified Partnership Entities, representatives of the Initial Purchasers and representatives of the Initial Purchasers’ counsel, during which conferences and conversations the contents of such documents and related matters were discussed.Subject to the foregoing, on the basis of the information we gained in the course of our participation in such conferences and conversations and our review of such documents, we confirm to you that:(a) The Incorporated Documents, at the time they were filed, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, except that (i) we express no view as to the financial statements, the notes and schedules thereto and other financial and accounting data and oil and gas reserve and production information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, and (ii) we express no view in this sentence as to the antifraud provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated under such provisions.
(b) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that (i) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of [            ] (New York time) on July 14, 2014 (which you have informed us is a time prior to the time of the first sale of the Notes by any Initial Purchaser), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Final Offering Memorandum, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in the case of each of clauses (i)-(ii) above, we do not express any view as to the financial statements, the notes and schedules thereto and other financial and accounting data and oil and gas reserve and production information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom.

(a) Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permissible under applicable law or Commission policy (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a) hereof have been complied with), the Issuers and the Guarantors shall (i) cause to be filed with the Commission sufficiently promptly so as to avoid a Registration Default with respect to the Exchange Offer, a Registration Statement under the Securities Act relating to the Exchange Securities (other than Transfer Restricted Securities acquired by any Broker-Dealer directly from the Issuers) and the Exchange Offer (the “Exchange Offer Registration Statement”), (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act sufficiently promptly so as to avoid a Registration Default with respect to the -4-
Exchange Offer, (iii) in connection with the foregoing, file (A) all pre-effective amendments to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective, (B) if applicable, a post-effective amendment to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A under the Securities Act and (C) cause all necessary filings in connection with the registration and qualification of the Exchange Securities to be made under the state securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of the Exchange Offer, and (iv) upon the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as promptly as practicable, commence the Exchange Offer.

If (i) the Issuers and the Guarantors are not required to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or to consummate the Exchange Offer for the Initial Securities because the Exchange Offer is not permitted by applicable law or Commission policy; (ii) for any reason the Exchange Offer for the Initial Securities is not Consummated by the Exchange Deadline (unless an Exchange Offer Registration Statement has been filed within 270 days of the Closing Date and has not yet been declared effective by the Commission, other than as a result of the fault of any Issuer or Guarantor, and as a result of Commission review of data or information included or incorporated by reference in such Registration Statement that would also be included or incorporated in a Shelf Registration Statement, the Issuers and Guarantors reasonably believe that a Shelf Registration Statement would not become effective prior to consummation of the Exchange Offer); or (iii) with respect to any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer or Guarantors (A) such Holder is prohibited by applicable law or Commission policy from participating in the Exchange Offer, (B) such Holder may not resell the Exchange Securities acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to the public without delivering a prospectus and that the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such resales by such Holder, or (C) such Holder is a Broker-Dealer and holds Initial Securities acquired directly from the Issuers or one of their Affiliates, then, upon such Holder’s written request within six months of the first to occur of the Exchange Date or the Exchange Deadline, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall (1) if permitted by law and Commission policy, cause the Transfer Restricted Securities of such Holder to be reissued in a form that does not bear any restrictive legends relating to the Securities Act and does not have a restrictive CUSIP number so that such Transfer Restricted Securities may be -6-
sold to the public in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act by a person that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors where no conditions of Rule 144 are then applicable (other than the holding period requirement in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of Rule 144 so long as such holding period requirement is satisfied at such time of such reissue) and (2) in the event the Issuers cannot or do not comply with the provisions of the foregoing clause within 20 Business Days of the later of (I) the date of receipt by the Issuer of such notice of such Holder and (II) the first to occur of the Exchange Date and the Exchange Deadline (such later date being a “Shelf Filing Deadline”), then the Issuers and the Guarantors shall:(x) as promptly as practicable cause to be filed a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, which may be an amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (in either event, the “Shelf Registration Statement”) on or prior to the Shelf Filing Deadline which Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer Restricted Securities the Holders of which shall have provided the information required pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof; and(y) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or before the 90th day after the Shelf Filing Deadline (or if such 90th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors shall keep any such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Initial Securities by the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a), and to ensure that it conforms in all material respects with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of one year following the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement (or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Initial Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement or may be sold without a restrictive legend pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor rule).
Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors shall be deemed not to have used commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if any of the Issuers or the Guarantors voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Transfer Restricted Securities during that period, unless (X) such action is required by applicable law or Commission policy; or (Y) such action is taken by any of the Issuers or Guarantors in good faith and for valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Issuers or the Guarantors obligations hereunder) including, but not limited to, the acquisition or divestiture of assets, so long as the Issuers and the Guarantors promptly thereafter comply with the requirements of the last paragraph of Section 6(c) hereof (the period during which the Shelf Registration Statement is not available under clauses (X) or (Y) above, the “Blackout Period”).

(a) The Issuers and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder and (ii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the Persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a “controlling person”) and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of any Holder or any controlling person (any Person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred to as an “Indemnified Holder”), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) including, without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of each such Indemnified Holder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim damage, liability or action, joint or several, directly or indirectly arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto) or necessary to make the statements therein (with respect to the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions are caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Issuers by any of the Holders expressly for use therein.
This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Issuers or any of the Guarantors may otherwise have.In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect -18-
to which indemnity may be sought against the Issuers or the Guarantors, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Issuers and the Guarantors in writing; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Issuers or any of the Guarantors of their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
Such Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid, as incurred, by the Issuers and the Guarantors (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Holder is not entitled to indemnification hereunder).
The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for such Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be reasonably designated by the Holders.
The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not be liable to any indemnified party for any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim, action, suit or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by the Issuers and the Guarantors in writing.
The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination (i) includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statements as to or any findings of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, the Guarantors and their respective directors, officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Issuers or any of the Guarantors, and the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of each such Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers and the Guarantors to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Issuers, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Issuers and the Guarantors, and the Issuers, the Guarantors, their respective directors and officers and such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph.
This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities may otherwise have.

(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement (which in the case of the Issuers and the Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Issuers and the Guarantors from the Initial Placement and in the case of the Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Initial Securities), the amount of Additional Interest which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions, and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and actions referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.The Issuers, the Guarantors and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Initial Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The Holders’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Initial Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.
