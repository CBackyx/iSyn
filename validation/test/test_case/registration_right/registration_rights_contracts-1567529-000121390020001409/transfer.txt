Subject to the conditions of this Section 2, at any time beginning six (6) months after the closing of the Holders’ investment in the Company pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”), if the Company shall receive a written request from the Holders that the Company file a registration statement on Form F-1 or such other long form or short form registration statement, including Form F-3 (if the Company is eligible to use Form F-3), then the Company shall, as soon as reasonably possible thereafter and in any event within ninety (90) days of the delivery of such written request by the Holders, and subject to the limitations of this Section 2, use its reasonable commercial efforts to file such a registration statement for the registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities that the Holders request.
If within ten (10) days of receipt of a written request from the Holders pursuant to Section 2.1, the Company gives notice to the Holders of the Company’s good faith intention to file a registration statement under the Securities Act for a public offering for a sale of the Company’s shares for its own account within ninety (90) days, provided that the Company makes reasonable good faith efforts to file such registration statement within such ninety (90) days and makes reasonable good faith efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; 2.3.5.
If the Company shall furnish to the Holders requesting a registration statement pursuant to this Section 2, an officer’s certificate signed by order of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Audit Committee”) stating that in the good faith judgment of the Audit Committee, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its shareholders for such registration statement to be effected at such time, in which event the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the Holders; provided that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the Company not more than once in any twelve (12) month period.
At any time and from time to time after the Closing, the Company shall notify the Holders of Registrable Securities in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of any registration statement under the Securities Act for purposes of a public offering of securities of the Company (but other than registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-8 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration relating solely to a SEC Rule 145 transaction on Form F-4 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future), other than in a demand registration pursuant to Section 2 or Section 4, and will afford each such Holder requesting to be included in such registration, in accordance with this Section 3.1, an opportunity to include in such registration statement all or part of such Registrable Securities held by such Holder.
Each Holder desiring to include in any such registration statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities held by it shall, within fourteen (14) days after delivery of the above-described notice by the Company, so notify the Company in writing specifying the number of Registrable Shares requested to be included.
Subject to the conditions of this Section 4, at any time beginning six (6) months after the Closing, if the Company shall receive a written request from the Holders that the Company file a registration statement for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the resale from time to time by the Holders thereof of Registrable Securities held by them (the “Shelf Registration Statement”), then the Company shall use reasonable commercial efforts to file the Shelf Registration Statement within ninety (90) days after the delivery of the Holders’ initial request and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act.
If within ten (10) days of receipt of a written request from the Holders pursuant to this Section 4, the Company gives notice to the Holders of the Company’s good faith intention to file a registration statement for a public offering within sixty (60) days, provided that the Company is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be filed within such sixty (60) days and makes commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; or 4.2.5.
If the Company shall furnish to the Holders requesting a registration statement pursuant to this Section 4, an officer’s certificate signed by order of the Audit Committee stating that in the good faith judgment of the Audit Committee, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its shareholders for such Shelf Registration Statement to be effected at such time, in which event the Company shall have the right to defer the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the initial request of the Holder or Holders under this Section 4; provided, that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the Company not more than once in any twelve (12) month period.
Upon receipt of such Suspension Notice, the Holders will discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement or Prospectus (a “Suspension”) until the Holders’ receipt of copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus prepared and filed by the Company, or until the Holders are advised in writing by the Company that the current Prospectus may be used, and have received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in any such prospectus.
In the event of any Suspension, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the use of the Prospectus so suspended to be resumed as soon as possible after delivery of a Suspension Notice to the Holders.
Prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and keep such registration statement effective until the earlier of (i) with respect to a registration effected pursuant to Section 4 – twenty four (24) months from its effective date, or in case of any other registration - one (1) year from the effective date, plus (in each case) such number of days equal to the duration of any suspensions pursuant to Section 4.3, if applicable, or (ii) the disposition of all Registrable Securities included in such registration statement.
Unless delivered earlier, the Company shall deliver to the Holders a copy of the approvals of such securities exchange to the listing of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement not later than the effective date of such registration statement; 5.6.
Provide a transfer agent, CUSIP number and registrar for all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement; 5.7.
The Company shall prepare and furnish to each such seller a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; 5.9.
