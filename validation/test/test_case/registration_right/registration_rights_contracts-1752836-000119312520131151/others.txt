(ii)    Any purported conversion (and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) will be void and have no effect to the extent, but only to the extent, that such conversion and delivery would result in any Holder becoming the beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of the Ownership Limitation.
For the avoidance of doubt, a Holder may effect an Optional Conversion, and the Company may, upon exercise of its Mandatory Conversion Right, force conversion of, a portion of such Holder’s Convertible Preferred Stock up to the Ownership Limitation, in each case subject to the other requirements of this Certificate of Designations applicable to such Optional Conversion or Mandatory Conversion, as applicable.
17
(iii)    Except as otherwise provided herein, if any consideration otherwise due upon the proposed conversion of any Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to an Optional Conversion or Mandatory Conversion is not delivered as a result of the Ownership Limitation, then the Company’s obligation to deliver such consideration will not be extinguished, and the Company will deliver such consideration (and the relevant shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed converted) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Holder of such Series A Preferred Stock provides written evidence satisfactory to the Company that such delivery will not contravene the Ownership Limitation.
A Holder will provide such evidence as soon as reasonably practicable after its beneficial ownership is such that additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock may be delivered without contravening the Ownership Limitation.
For the avoidance of doubt, until consideration due upon the conversion of any Series A Preferred Stock is delivered, such Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed not to have converted, Preferred Dividends shall continue to accrue thereon and consideration ultimately paid out in respect thereof shall take into account such accrued Preferred Dividends (to the extent not previously paid as Cash Dividends).SECTION 9.

The Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, upon the occurrence of the following events, except that the Company shall not make any adjustment to the Conversion Rate if Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock participate, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of Common Stock and solely as a result of holding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in any transaction described in this Section 10, without having to convert their Series A Preferred Stock, as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate multiplied by the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holders:(i)    The issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination (including, without limitation, a stock split or a reverse stock split) of Common Stock or a reclassification of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x (OS1 / OS0)where,CR0    =    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to (i) the close of business on (i) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or (ii) the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification;CR1    =    the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after (i) the close of business on (i) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or (ii) the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification;OS0    =    the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on (i) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or (ii) the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification; and 21
OS1    = the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after, and solely as a result of, the completion of such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification.Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall be effective immediately after the close of business on (i) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or (ii) the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification.
If any such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification is announced or declared but does not occur, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board announces that such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification shall not occur to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification had not been declared.
than the Current Market Price as of the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights, options or warrants, and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be the Fair Market Value thereof.Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall become effective immediately following the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or other issuance.
In the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board publicly announced its decision not to issue such rights, options or warrants to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution or issuance had not been declared.
To the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights, options or warrants upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the dividend, distribution or other issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
If any such dividend or distribution is declared but does not occur, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board announces that such dividend or distribution shall not occur to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required under this Section 10(a)(iv), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that 24
may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Section 10(a)(iv) shall be delayed only to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 10(a)(iv).
(v)    If the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, Holders of such shares will receive, in addition to the applicable number of shares of Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan relating to such Common Stock, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have (i) become exercisable or (ii) separated from the shares of Common Stock (the first of such events to occur, a “Trigger Event”), in which case, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted, effective automatically at the time of such Trigger Event, as if the Company had made a distribution of such rights to all holders of the Company Common Stock as described in Section 10(a)(ii) (without giving effect to the forty-five (45)-day limit on the exercisability of rights, options or warrants ordinarily subject to such Section 10(a)(ii)), subject to appropriate readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights prior to the exercise, deemed exercise or exchange thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such stockholder rights are exchanged by the Company for shares of Common Stock or other property or securities, the Conversion Rate shall be appropriately readjusted as if such stockholder rights had not been issued, but the Company had instead issued such shares of Common Stock or other property or securities as a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) or Section 10(a)(iii), as applicable.To the extent that such rights are not exercised prior to their expiration, termination or redemption, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event been made on the basis of the issuance of, and the receipt of the exercise price with respect to, only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued pursuant to such rights.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10(a)(v), no adjustment shall be required to be made to the Conversion Rate with respect to any Holder which is, or is an “affiliate” or “associate” of, an “acquiring person” under such stockholder rights plan or with respect to any direct or indirect transferee of such Holder who receives Series A Preferred Stock in such transfer after the time such Holder becomes, or its affiliate or associate becomes, such an “acquiring person.”(b)    Calculation of Adjustments.
No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required, unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the Conversion Rate; provided, however, that any such adjustment that is not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; provided, further, that any such adjustment of less than one percent (1%) that has not been made will be made upon any Conversion Date.
(c)    When No Adjustment Required.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing, or for the repurchase of Common Stock.
25
(ii)    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted as a result of the issuance of, the distribution of separate certificates representing, the exercise or redemption of, or the termination or invalidation of, rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plans.
(iii)    No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made:(A)    upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan in which purchases are made at market prices on the date or dates of purchase, without discount, and whether or not the Company bears the ordinary costs of administration and operation of the plan, including brokerage commissions;(B)    upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase such shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any employee agreements or arrangements or programs;(C)    upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security;(D)    for dividends or distributions declared or paid to holders of Common Stock in which Holders participate pursuant to Section 4(b); or(E)    for a change solely in the par value of the Common Stock.
(d)    Successive Adjustments.
After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 10, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 10 shall cause an adjustment to each such Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
(e)    Multiple Adjustments.
For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder; provided, however, that if more than one subsection of this Section 10 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment.
(f)    Tax Adjustments.
The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 10, as the Board considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.
26
(g)    Notice of Adjustments.
Adjustment for Reorganization Events.
(a)    Reorganization Events.
In the event of:(i)    any reclassification, statutory exchange, merger, consolidation or other similar business combination of the Company with or into another Person, in each case, pursuant to which at least a majority of the Common Stock is changed or converted into, or exchanged for, cash, securities or other property of the Company or another Person; 27
(ii)    any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property; or(iii)    any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or reclassification, recapitalization or reorganization of the Common Stock into other securities;(each of which is referred to as a “Reorganization Event” and the cash, securities or other property into which the Common Stock is changed, converted or exchanged, the “Exchange Property” and the amount and kind of Exchange Property that a holder of one (1) share of Common Stock would be entitled to receive on account of such Reorganization Event (without giving effect to any arrangement not to issue or deliver a fractional portion of any security or other property), an “Exchange Property Unit”), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, from and after the effective time of such Reorganization Event, without the consent of the Holders, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will remain outstanding (unless converted in accordance with Section 11(d)) and (I) the consideration due upon conversion of any Series A Preferred Stock will be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in Section 10 or in this Section 11, or in any related definitions, were instead a reference to the same number of Exchange Property Units; (II) for purposes of Sections 6 and 7, each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in such Sections (or in any related definitions) will instead be deemed to be a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units (and the terms of any conversion shall be based upon the Liquidation Value and Accrued Dividends at the time of such subsequent conversion); (III) for purposes of the definition of “Change of Control” and related concepts, the term “Common Stock” will be deemed to mean the common equity (including depositary receipts representing common equity), if any, forming part of such Exchange Property; and (IV) other references to “Common Stock” shall refer to the Exchange Property with appropriate adjustment to preserve, to the greatest extent possible (so long as there is no detrimental effect to the Company), the economic and other rights in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock granted by this Certificate of Designations and the Investment Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply if such Holder is a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a “Constituent Person”), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person, to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by such Persons.
If the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person (other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof), then for the purpose of this Section 11(a), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon conversion following such Reorganization Event will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock.
(b)    Successive Reorganization Events.
The above provisions of this Section 11 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
28
(c)    Reorganization Event Notice.
(d)    Reorganization Event Agreements.
The Company shall not enter into any agreement for a transaction constituting a Reorganization Event, unless (i) such agreement provides for or does not interfere with or prevent (as applicable) conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into the Exchange Property in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to this Section 11, and (ii) to the extent that the Company is not the surviving corporation in such Reorganization Event or will be dissolved in connection with such Reorganization Event, proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such Reorganization Event for the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into stock of the Person surviving such Reorganization Event or such other continuing entity in such Reorganization Event.
(e)    Change of Control.
For the sake of clarity, if a Reorganization Event constitutes a Change of Control, then Section 9 shall take precedence over this Section 11 to the extent there is any inconsistency between such sections.SECTION 12.
Voting Rights.
(a)    General.
The Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote with the holders of the Common Stock on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company, except as otherwise provided herein or as required by applicable law, voting together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.
For such purposes, each Holder shall be entitled to a number of votes in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned of record by it equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted (taking into account the limitations in Section 8(f), applied ratably with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock) as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no such record date is established, as of the date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders is solicited; provided, however, that the Investor Parties that hold shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights in respect of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at any stockholders’ meeting or in any written consent of stockholders, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Investor Parties would have the right to a number of votes in respect of such Investor Parties’ shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other Capital Stock of the Company in excess of nineteen and ninety-nine-one-hundredths percent (19.99%) of the then-outstanding Stockholder Voting Power.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that the issuance, delivery, conversion or convertibility of such Series A Preferred Stock would result in such Holder or a “person” or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning in excess of the Ownership Limitation prior to the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
The Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws as if they were holders of record of Common Stock for such meeting.
29
(b)    Adverse Changes.
So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law, the Company may not take any of the following actions (including by means of merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) without the prior affirmative vote or written consent from the Holders of at least a majority of the then-issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, voting as a separate class:(i)    amend, alter, repeal or otherwise modify (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation (including this Certificate of Designations) in a manner that would adversely affect the powers, preferences, rights or privileges of the Series A Preferred Stock;(ii)    authorize, create, increase the authorized amount of, or issue any class or series of Senior Stock or Parity Stock or any security convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for any of the foregoing, or reclassify any security into, any Senior Stock or Parity Stock (provided, however, that the authorization, creation, increase in the authorized amount of, or issuance of any class or series of Junior Stock or any security convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for any of the foregoing, or reclassification of any security into, Junior Stock will not require the vote or consent of any Holders); and(iii)    increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (except for the cancellation and retirement of shares set forth in Section 14 or issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
(c)    Each Holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have one (1) vote per share on any matter on which Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class, whether at a meeting or by written consent.
(d)    The vote or consent of the Holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, will be sufficient to waive or amend the provisions of Section 9(i), and any amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 9(i) approved by such percentage of the Holders shall be binding on all of the Holders.
(e)    For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, the Holders shall have the exclusive consent and voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) and may take action or consent to any action with respect to such rights without a meeting by delivering a consent in writing or by electronic transmission of the Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize, take or consent to such action at a meeting of stockholders.SECTION 13.
The Company may appoint a transfer agent and remove its transfer agent in accordance with the agreement between the Company and such transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall appoint a successor transfer agent of recognized standing who shall accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of such 30
When a Holder requests to register the transfer of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company or the Company’s transfer agent, as applicable, shall register the transfer as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met.SECTION 14.
Status of Shares.
Shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner, whether by redemption, repurchase or otherwise or upon any conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Common Stock, shall thereupon be retired and shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock of the Company undesignated as to series, and may be redesignated as any series of preferred stock of the Company and reissued.SECTION 15.

The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than the name in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any Person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment, unless and until the Person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
All payments and distributions (or deemed distributions) on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (and on the shares of Common Stock received upon their conversion) shall be subject to withholding and backup withholding of taxes to the extent required by law, subject to applicable exemptions, and amounts withheld, if any, shall be treated as received by the Holders.SECTION 19.
Facts Ascertainable.
When the terms of this Certificate of Designations refer to a specific agreement or other document to determine the meaning or operation of a provision hereof, the Secretary of the Company shall maintain a copy of such agreement or document at the principal executive offices of the Company and a copy thereof shall be provided free of charge to any Holder who makes a request therefor.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, any provision contained herein and any right of the Holders of Series A Preferred Stock granted hereunder may be waived as to all shares of Series A Preferred Stock (and the Holders thereof) upon the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.SECTION 22.
Severability.
If any term of the Series A Preferred Stock set forth herein is invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public policy, all other terms set forth herein, which can be given effect without the invalid, unlawful or unenforceable term will, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, and no term herein set forth will be deemed dependent upon any other such term, unless so expressed herein.SECTION 23.

Statement becomes effective, in either case, in compliance with Section 1.3), it being understood that the occurrence of an event described in clause (x) or (y) shall not have any effect on the Company’s obligation to pay Registration Expenses pursuant to Section 2.3; and provided further, that the Company shall not be required to effectuate a Demand Registration if an effective Registration Statement covering such shares is on file.Section 1.2    Effectiveness Period.
Once declared effective, the Company shall, subject to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Initial Shelf Registration Statement to be continuously effective and usable until such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities (the “Effectiveness Period”).Section 1.3    Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement.
If any Initial Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective under the Securities Act for any reason at any time during the Effectiveness Period, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable cause such Initial Shelf Registration Statement to again become effective under the Securities Act (including obtaining the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Initial Shelf Registration Statement), and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable amend such Initial Shelf Registration Statement in a manner reasonably expected to result in the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Initial Shelf Registration Statement, or file an additional Shelf Registration Statement (a “Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement”) for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the resale from time to time by the Holders thereof of all securities that are Registrable Securities as of the time of such filing.
If a Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement is filed, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the filing thereof and (b) keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and usable until the end of the Effectiveness Period.

Otherwise, such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement shall be on another appropriate form and shall provide for the registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders in accordance with any reasonable method of distribution elected by the Holders of a Majority of the Registrable Securities covered thereby.Section 1.4    Supplements and Amendments.

Section 1.6    Underwritten Offering.
(b)    In the event of an Underwritten Offering, the Requesting Holders shall select the managing underwriter(s) to administer the Underwritten Offering; provided that the choice of such managing underwriter(s) shall be subject to the consent of the Company, which is not to be unreasonably withheld.
In making the determination to consent to such Holder’s choice of managing underwriter(s), the Company may take into account its business and strategic interests.
The Company and the Holders of Registrable Securities participating in the Underwritten Offering will enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering.
(c)    The Company may include in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Section 1.6 any securities that are not Registrable Securities.
If the managing underwriter or underwriters advise the Company and the Holders participating in any Underwritten Offering in writing that in its or their good faith opinion the number of Registrable Securities (and, if permitted hereunder, other securities requested to be included in such offering) exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in such offering in light of market conditions or is such so as to adversely affect the success of such offering, the Company will include in such offering only such number of securities that can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, which securities will be so included in the following order of priority: (i) first, the Registrable Securities of the Holders that have requested to participate in such Underwritten Offering, allocated pro rata among such Holders on the basis of the Holders’ then-current ownership of Registrable Securities, and (ii) second, any other securities of the Company that have been requested to be so included.Section 1.7    Take-Down Notice.

The Company shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement (if other than a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 1.1 or Section 1.3) beyond the earlier of (x) 180 days after the effective date thereof and (y) consummation of the distribution by the Holders of the Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement.
(b)    If any of the securities to be registered pursuant to any public offering giving rise to the rights under this Section 1.8 are to be sold in an underwritten public offering, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit Holders of Registrable Securities who have timely submitted a Piggyback Request in connection with such offering to include in such offering all Registrable Securities included in each Holder’s Piggyback Request on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as any other shares of capital stock, if any, of the Company included in the offering.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such underwritten offering advise the Company in writing that in its or their good faith opinion the number of securities exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in such offering in light of market conditions or is such so as to adversely affect the success of such offering, the Company will include in such offering only such number of securities that can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, which securities will be so included in the following order of priority: (i) first, the securities proposed to be sold by the Company for its own account if such underwritten offering was initially proposed by the Company; (ii) second, the Registrable Securities of the Holders that have requested to participate in such underwritten offering, allocated pro rata among such Holders on the basis of the Holders’ then-current ownership of Registrable Securities; (iii) third, any other securities of the Company that have been requested to be included in such offering; provided that Holders may, prior to the time at which the offering price or underwriter’s discount is determined with the managing underwriter or underwriters, withdraw their request to be included in such underwritten public offering pursuant to this Section 1.8.ARTICLE IIAdditional Provisions Regarding Registration RightsSection 2.1    Registration Procedures.
Subject to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, in the case of each registration of Registrable Securities effected by the Company pursuant to Article I, the Company will:(a)    prepare and promptly file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to such securities and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective for the period of the distribution contemplated thereby, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement;(b)    prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the period specified in paragraph (a) above and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement in accordance with the method of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement for such period;(c)    furnish to any selling Holder copies of the Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus) proposed to be filed and provide such selling Holder a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Registration Statement; 4

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company will, with respect to any Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement or prospectus, or as to which registration, qualification or compliance under applicable “blue sky” laws has been effected pursuant to this Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, each Holder’s current and former officers, directors, partners, members, managers, shareholders, accountants, attorneys, agents and employees, and each Person controlling such Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and such Holder’s current and former officers, directors, partners, members, managers, shareholders, accountants, attorneys, agents and employees, and each underwriter thereof, if any, and each Person who controls any such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (collectively, the “Company Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all expenses, claims, losses, damages, costs (including costs of preparation and reasonable attorney’s fees and any legal or other fees or expenses actually incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding), judgments, fines, penalties, charges, amounts paid in settlement and other liabilities, joint or several, (or actions in respect thereof) (collectively, “Losses”) to the extent arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, offering circular, “issuer free writing prospectus” (as such term is defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) or other document, in each case related to such Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by the Company of 9

To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Holder will, if Registrable Securities held by such Holder are included in the securities as to which registration or qualification or compliance under applicable “blue sky” laws is being effected, indemnify, severally and not jointly with any other Holders of Registrable Securities, the Company, each of its representatives, each Person who controls the Company or such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (collectively, the “Holder Indemnified Parties”), against all Losses (or actions in respect thereof) to the extent arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, offering circular or “issuer free writing prospectus”, in each case related to such Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each of the Holder Indemnified Parties for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal expenses and any other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with investigating, defending or, subject to the last sentence of this Section 3.2, settling any such Losses or action, as such expenses are incurred, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such Registration Statement, prospectus, offering circular or “issuer free writing prospectus” in reliance upon and in conformity with written information regarding such Holder furnished to the Company by such Holder or its authorized representatives expressly for use therein; provided, however, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 3.2 payable by any Holder exceed an amount equal to the net proceeds received by such Holder in respect of the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Registration Statement.

If any Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article III (each, an “Indemnified Party”), such Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice to the party required to provide indemnification (each, an “Indemnifying Party”) of any claim or of the commencement of any proceeding as to which indemnity is sought.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party as promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt of written notice from such Indemnified Party of such claim or proceeding, to, unless in the Indemnified Party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, assume, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, the defense of any such claim or litigation, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such Indemnified Party hereunder for any legal expenses and other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such claim or litigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed within a reasonable period of time to assume, or in the event of a conflict of interest cannot assume, such defense or shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party.
The failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall relieve an Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this 10
Article III only to the extent that the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial or harmful to such Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such action.
No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the prior written consent of each Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not (x) include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or (y) involve the imposition of equitable remedies or the imposition of any obligations on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects such Indemnified Party other than as a result of financial obligations for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder.
The indemnity agreements contained in this Article III shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, loss, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The indemnification set forth in this Article III shall be in addition to any other indemnification rights or agreements that an Indemnified Party may have.
An Indemnifying Party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with one local counsel, if appropriate) for all parties indemnified by such Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any Indemnified Party a conflict of interest may exist between such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Parties with respect to such claim.Section 3.4    Contribution.
If the indemnification provided for in this Article III is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party, other than pursuant to its terms, with respect to any Losses or action referred to therein, then, subject to the limitations contained in this Article III, the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made (or omitted) by, or relates to information supplied by such Indemnifying Party or such Indemnified Party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission.
The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 3.4 was determined solely upon pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 3.4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount any Holder will be obligated to contribute pursuant to this Section 3.4 will be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by such Holder in respect of the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Registration Statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.ARTICLE IVTransfer and Termination of Registration RightsSection 4.1    Transfer of Registration Rights.
