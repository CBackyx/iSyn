(i)                                     Conversion of Company Common Stock; Potential Post-Closing Consideration.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Option and RSU shall be entitled to a contingent right to a portion of the Potential Post-Closing Consideration payable, without interest, to the applicable holder in accordance with Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(d), Section 2.7, and/or Section 2.10, as applicable.

Prior to the Closing, the Company and the board of directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such other actions as necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of this Section 2.7(a)(i) and the Company shall otherwise take all actions necessary so that, at the Effective Time, all Cash-Settled Options under the Stock Option Plan and the 2018 Stock Option Plan that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have been terminated and extinguished without any ongoing liability to the Surviving Subsidiaries.

Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of the Transaction Proposals, including by soliciting proxies as promptly as practicable in accordance with applicable Law and its Organizational Documents for the purpose of approving the Transaction Proposals; provided that the foregoing shall not in any event preclude a Change in Recommendation to the extent permitted by this Section 5.12.

Parent agrees that its obligation to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on the Transaction Proposals shall not be affected by any Change in Recommendation, and Parent agrees to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting and submit for the approval of its stockholders the matters contemplated by the Proxy Statement, regardless of whether or not there shall be any Change in Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions (a) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the board of directors of Parent has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law is disclosed to Parent’s stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to the Parent’s stockholders prior to the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting, (b) if, as of the time for which the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Class F Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting, (c) by up to ten (10) Business Days if, as of the deadline for electing redemption by holders of Offering Shares, the number of shares being redeemed would cause the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.1(g) not be satisfied, or (d) by up to ten (10) Business Days in order to solicit additional proxies from stockholders in favor of the adoption of the Transaction Proposals; provided, that in the event of a postponement or adjournment pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above, the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting shall be reconvened as promptly as practicable following such time as the matters described in such clauses have been resolved, and in no event shall the Parent Common Stockholders Meeting be reconvened on a date that is later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

Section 9.3                                    Severability.
If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Section 9.4                                    Binding Effect; Assignment.
This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly, including by operation of law, by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided, that the Parent Parties shall be permitted, without the consent of any other party hereto, to make a collateral assignment
86
to any lender (or agent thereof) providing the Debt Financing or to make an assignment of any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding any such assignment, the Parent Parties shall remain liable and responsible for all of their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
Section 9.5                                    No Third Party Beneficiaries.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.10, Section 9.16 and Section 9.20, this Agreement is exclusively for the benefit of the Company, and its respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement, and for the benefit of the Parent Parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the Parties acknowledges to each of the Financing Sources, as a third party beneficiary, their direct rights against it under the Financing Source Sections, which are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Financing Source, its heirs and its legal representatives.
Section 9.6                                    Section Headings.
The Table of Contents and the Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are exclusively for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Section 9.7                                    Consent to Jurisdiction, etc.
Each Party hereby and any Person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be brought only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this Section 9.7 is pending before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim, cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court.
Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason, (b) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such court, (c) such Party’s property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or (e) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper.
A final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in this Section 9.7 following the expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay during appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws.
EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR
87
COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING THERETO.
FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.
Section 9.8                                    Entire Agreement.
This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in entering into this Agreement, such Party has not relied on any promises or assurances, written or oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto) or the Ancillary Agreements.
Section 9.9                                    Governing Law.
This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) or matters (including matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement), shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the internal substantive and procedural laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations (without regard to any borrowing statute that would result in the application of the statute of limitations of any other jurisdiction and regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof).
Section 9.10                             Specific Performance.
(a)                                 The Parties acknowledge that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that such non-breaching Party shall have the right to enforce its rights and the other Party’s obligations hereunder by an action or actions for specific performance and/or injunctive relief (without posting of bond or other security), including any order, injunction or decree sought by such non-breaching Party to cause the other Party to perform its/their respective agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and to cure breaches of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual harm and/or damages or posting a bond or other security therefore.
Each Party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for any such equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.
88
Section 9.11                             Counterparts.

(a)                                 The Stockholders’ Representative shall hold the Administrative Expense Amount in the Administrative Expense Account as a fund from which the Stockholders’ Representative may pay any amounts due by the Equity Holders hereunder, including, any losses, third-party fees, expenses or costs it incurs in performing its duties and obligations under this Agreement by or on behalf of the Equity Holders, including fees and expenses incurred pursuant to the procedures and provisions set forth in Section 2.12 and Section 5.9 and legal and consultant fees, expenses and costs for reviewing, analyzing and defending any claim or process arising under or pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (collectively, “Administrative Costs”).
89
(b)                                 Amounts drawn from the Administrative Expense Account to pay Administrative Costs shall be drawn to reflect each Equity Holder’s liability for such Administrative Costs in accordance with its respective Pro Rata Percentage.
(d)                                 The Stockholders’ Representative, or the Company, if requested by the Stockholders’ Representative, shall report and withhold any Taxes from amounts paid by or from the Administrative Expense Account as it determines may be required by any Law or regulation in effect at the time of any distribution.
(e)                                  In the event that any amount is owed to the Stockholders’ Representative, in its capacity as such, whether for expense reimbursement or indemnification, that is in excess of the Administrative Expense Amount, the Stockholders’ Representative shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Equity Holders (including by offsetting such amount against any amounts owed to the Equity Holders).
Section 9.14                             Stockholders’ Representative.
(a)                                 By adoption of this Agreement, execution of a Company Letter of Transmittal, and the acceptance of any portion of the Merger Consideration, each Equity Holder hereby designates the Stockholders’ Representative to execute any and all instruments or other documents on behalf of such Equity Holder, and to do any and all other acts or things on behalf of such Equity Holder, which the Stockholders’ Representative may deem necessary or advisable, or which may be required pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and the performance of all obligations hereunder or thereunder at or following the Closing, including, but not limited to, the exercise of the power to: (i) execute the Ancillary Agreements on behalf of each Equity Holder; (ii) act for each Equity Holder with respect to any Merger Consideration Adjustment and the Ancillary Agreements; (iii) give and receive notices and communications to or from the Parent Parties and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such Equity Holders individually); and (iv) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders’ Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

(b)                                 In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the Stockholders’ Representative shall not be liable to any Equity Holder for any damages, losses or liabilities whatsoever, other than actual losses that are determined by a final, non-appealable judgement of Delaware court to have been primarily caused by the willful misconduct of the Stockholders’ Representative.
Each Equity Holder shall severally (based on each such Equity Holder’s Pro Rata Percentage), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders’ Representative from and against any loss incurred on the part of the Stockholders’ Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder (other than losses that are determined by a final, non-appealable judgement of Delaware court to have been primarily caused by the willful misconduct of the Stockholders’ Representative).
In connection with this Agreement, and any instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Stockholders’ Representative hereunder (i) the Stockholders’ Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Equity Holder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful misconduct and (ii) the Stockholders’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the Stockholders’ Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Stockholders’ Representative to liability to any Equity Holder.

The Stockholders’ Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement or otherwise a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Equity Holder.
(d)                                 The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Equity Holder and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement in respect of which the applicability of such disclosure is
91
reasonably apparent on its face.
Disclosure of any fact or item, including for the avoidance any dollar amount, in any Section of the Schedules shall not be considered an admission by the disclosing party that such item or fact (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or that such item or fact will in fact exceed any applicable threshold limitation set forth in this Agreement and shall not be construed as an admission by the disclosing party of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party rights (including but not limited to any Intellectual Property rights) or any Law, such disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to the representations made herein or of disclosing any information required to be disclosed under this Agreement.
The Schedules and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, and do not, except as expressly set forth in the representations and warranties which they qualify, constitute representations and warranties as to the matters described therein.

Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Ancillary Agreements, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement (each such above-described legal, equitable or other theories of liability, a “Recourse Theory”), may be made only against (and such representations and warranties are those solely of), and are expressly limited to, the Parties and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party.

Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Laws (other than as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements), (a) each Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Party or otherwise impose liability of a Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b) each Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to
92
the performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.16 shall in any way limit the rights of the Company from and after the Closing Date under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive debt documents executed in connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, under this Agreement) to the extent that the Company is party thereto, and nothing in this Section 9.16 shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter to each other or in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Parties hereby agrees (i) that it will not bring or support an action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof (any of the foregoing, a “Financing Source Action”), in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof) and (ii) to waive, and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Financing Source Action.

The Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration may request that the registration be made pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (a “Shelf Registration”) and, if the Company is a WKSI at the time any request for a Demand Registration is submitted to the Company, that such Shelf Registration be an automatic shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (an “Automatic Shelf Registration Statement”).
Each such request for a Shelf Registration shall specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered and the intended method of distribution, which shall permit, in addition to firm commitment Underwritten Offerings, any other lawful means of disposition of Registrable Securities.

2.3.2                     Non-Underwritten Shelf Offerings.
A Holder’s election to sell Shelf Registrable Securities in a Shelf Offering that is not an Underwritten Offering shall not trigger any notification or participation rights hereunder.

Each Holder agrees that such Holder shall treat as confidential the Shelf Offering Notice and shall not disclose or use the information contained in the Company’s notice regarding the Shelf Offering Notice without the prior written consent of the Company and the Holders of Registrable Securities initiating such Shelf Offering until such time as the information contained therein is or becomes available to the public generally, other than as a result of disclosure by the Holder in breach of the terms of this Agreement.
2.3.4                     Block Trades.

All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering shall comply with the requirements under Section 3.3.

3.1.22              otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection with such Registration.

3.4                               Holdback Agreements.

The Company (i) shall not file any Registration Statement for an offering of its equity securities, options or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities or cause any such Registration Statement to become effective, or effect any public sale or distribution of its equity securities, or any securities, options or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities (other than as part of such Underwritten Offering or pursuant to a Special Registration Statement) during any Follow-on Holdback Period and (ii) shall use its best efforts to cause (A) each holder of at least 5.0% (on a fully-diluted basis) of its Common Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock, and (B) each of its directors and executive officers to agree not to effect any Sale Transaction during any Follow-on Holdback Period, except as part of such Underwritten Offering and subject to customary exceptions, if otherwise permitted, unless the Underwriters managing the Underwritten Offering otherwise agree in writing.
3.5                               Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure.
If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Company’s control, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event more than sixty (60) days, determined in good faith by the Board to be necessary for such purpose, or more than once in any 12-month period.
In the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities.
The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights under this Section 3.4 and shall not make use of the rights under this Section 3.4 more than once in any 12-month period.
3.6                               Reporting Obligations.

The Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of the Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal opinions.
D-18
3.7                               In-Kind Distributions.

ARTICLE V
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION
5.1                               Indemnification.
5.1.1                     The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers, directors, partners, stockholders or members and each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act) from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company will reimburse such indemnitee for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same, except insofar as the same arise out of or are based upon
D-19
an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such filing in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder, relating to such Holder, expressly for use therein.
The Company shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.
5.1.2                     In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act) from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and such Holder will reimburse the Company and such other indemnitees for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same, but only to the extent that the same arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such filing in reliance upon and in conformity with any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder, relating to such Holder, expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no Underwriter shall require any Holder of Registrable Securities to provide any indemnification other than that provided hereinabove in this Section 5.1.2, and, if, despite the Company’s commercially reasonable efforts, an Underwriter requires any Holder of Registrable Securities to provide additional indemnification, such Holder may elect not to participate in such Underwritten Offering (but shall not have any claim against the Company as a result of such election).
5.1.3                     Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any person’s right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects
D-20
not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) and which settlement includes a statement or admission of fault or culpability on the part of such indemnified party or does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.
5.1.4                     The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director, partner, stockholders or members, or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of Registrable Securities.
5.1.5                     If the indemnification provided under Section 5.1 hereof from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses shall be determined by reference to, among other filings, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party’s and indemnified party’s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action; provided, however, that the liability of any Holder or any director, officer or controlling person thereof under this subsection 5.1.5 shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in subsections 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection 5.1.5 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this subsection 5.1.5.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this subsection 5.1.5 from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and  other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficient of which are hereby acknowledged, each of the parties to this Agreement agrees as follows:
1.

(1)                                 NTD: Separate director nomination agreements to be entered into with IPC and THL.

(g)                                  The Company shall use its best efforts to maintain in effect at all times directors and officers indemnity insurance coverage reasonably satisfactory to the Shareholder and the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (each as may be further amended, supplemented or waived in accordance with its terms) shall at all times provide for indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.

Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit, claim or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein, and no party will file a motion to dismiss any action filed in a state or federal court in the State of Delaware, on any jurisdictional or venue-related grounds, including the doctrine of forum non-conveniens.
Each party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such action, suit, claim or proceeding by delivery of such process in the manner provided in Section 12(a) and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise) in any action, suit, claim or proceeding any claim that service of process made in accordance with Section 12(a) does not constitute good and valid service of process.

ARTICLE II
DETERMINATION OF REALIZED TAX BENEFIT
Section 2.1.
Tax Benefit Schedule.
(a)                                 Tax Benefit Schedule.
The Tax Benefit Schedule will become final as provided in Section 2.2(a) and may be amended as provided in Section 2.2(b)).
(b)                                 Applicable Principles.
The Realized Tax Benefit for each Taxable Year is intended to measure the decrease in the modified liability for Taxes of PubCo and its Subsidiaries for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax Benefits and the TRA Tax Benefits.
It is intended that the provisions of this Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of any amount
I-8
(including interest) required under this Agreement.
For the purposes of calculating the Realized Tax Benefit, the liability for Taxes in a Taxable Year shall be calculated as if the UHS Group’s NOLs are utilized prior to (i) any net operating losses generated by Parent prior to the Closing, (ii) any net operating losses generated by PubCo and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, and (iii) any net operating losses generated by the PubCo and its Subsidiaries at any time following the Closing, in each case as determined by PubCo, and the Company may use reasonable estimation methodologies for calculating the portion of the Realized Tax Benefit attributable to U.S. state or local Taxes.
For the avoidance of doubt, the liability for Taxes will take into account (x) the deduction of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted for as interest under the Code based upon the characterization of Tax Benefit Payments as additional consideration payable by the Company as consideration in Company Merger 2, and (y) any payments made pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Cash Settled Options, Rollover Options or RSUs shall be treated as compensatory payments for services and shall be deductible as such by PubCo and its Subsidiaries, as applicable.
In the event of a Section 382 Ownership Change following the date hereof, all amounts payable under this Agreement, including any Tax Benefit Payments, shall, under all circumstances, continue to be calculated in all respects as if such Section 382 Ownership Change had not occurred.
Carryovers or carrybacks of any NOL or other Tax item shall be considered to be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or the appropriate provisions of applicable law governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type; provided that all amounts payable under this Agreement, including any Tax Benefit Payments, shall, under all circumstances, continue to be calculated in all regards as if the NOLs have not expired.
Section 2.2.
Procedures, Amendments.
(a)                                 Procedure.
I-9

(b)                                 Amended Schedule.
The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year may be amended from time to time by the Company (i) in connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct inaccuracies in the Schedule, (iii) to comply with the Expert’s determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a Tax item to such Taxable Year, or (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year (any such Schedule, an “Amended Schedule”).
ARTICLE III
TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS
Section 3.1.
(a)                                 Payments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Tax Benefit Payments paid on or before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date in respect of any of the Cash Settled Options, Rollover Options or RSUs of the Sellers are intended to qualify as “transaction-based compensation” under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A).
(b)                                 Tax Benefit Payments; Net Tax Benefit; Interest Amount.
Exhibit A attached hereto sets forth the Company’s good faith estimate of applicable NOLs and Deductible Expenses as of the Closing
I-10
(i)                                     the Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of such Taxable Year, plus
(ii)                                  the amount of the excess, if any, of the Realized Tax Benefit reflected on an Amended Tax Benefit Schedule for a previous Taxable Year over the Realized Tax Benefit reflected on the Tax Benefit Schedule for such previous Taxable Year, minus
(iii)                               the amount of the excess, if any, of the Realized Tax Benefit reflected on a Tax Benefit Schedule for a previous Taxable Year over the Realized Tax Benefit reflected on the Amended Tax Benefit Schedule for such previous Taxable Year;
provided, however, that to the extent the amounts described in Section 3.1(b)(ii) and Section 3.1(b)(iii) were taken into account in determining any Tax Benefit Payment in a preceding Taxable Year, such amounts shall not be taken into account in determining a Tax Benefit Payment attributable to any other Taxable Year; provided, however, that to the extent that an amount described in Section 3.1(b)(iii) does not actually reduce the Tax Benefit Payment for a Taxable Year because the Tax Benefit Payment cannot be less than zero, such amount shall be carried forward and applied to future Tax Benefit Payments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each Taxable Year ending on or after the date of a Change of Control, all Tax Benefit Payments shall be calculated by utilizing the Valuation Assumptions substituting the terms “the closing date of a Change of Control” for an “Early Termination Date” in the definition thereof.
Section 3.2.
The amount of all or any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made to the Sellers when due under the terms of this Agreement shall be payable together with any interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate and commencing from the date on which such Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment was properly due and payable.

Guarantee.

PubCo hereby agrees that, if the Company fails to pay in full when due any amount outstanding under any of the Company’s obligations hereunder, PubCo shall promptly pay the same in cash, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Company’s obligations hereunder, the same will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
The obligations of PubCo under this Section 3.3 shall constitute a guaranty of payment and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Company’s obligations hereunder or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, and, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or PubCo
I-11
The guarantee in this Section 3.3 is a continuing guarantee of payment and shall apply to all obligations of the Company hereunder whenever arising.
PubCo hereby agrees that, until the payment in full in cash and satisfaction in full of all of the amount outstanding under, or the timely performance of, all of the Company’s obligations hereunder and the expiration and termination of this Agreement, it shall subordinate any claim and shall not exercise any right or remedy, direct or indirect, arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in this Section 3.3, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against the Sellers or the Stockholders’ Representative.

The parties agree that the failure of the Company to make any payment due pursuant to this Agreement within three (3) months of the date such payment is due shall be deemed to be a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement, and that it will not be considered to be a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to this Agreement until three (3) months of the date such payment is due.
Section 4.3.

(e)                                  The arbitrators may grant any legal or equitable remedy that would otherwise be available from a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable Law, including specific performance or injunctive relief; provided, however, that before the arbitration panel is selected as provided in this Agreement, provisional relief, including temporary restraining orders, temporary protective orders, and preliminary injunctive relief, pending arbitration or in aid of arbitration or both shall be available solely from the federal and state courts of the State of New York as provided in Section 12.8 or pursuant to the JAMS Emergency Relief Procedures.
(f)                                   Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof and enforcement of the award may be sought in any manner permitted by applicable Law.
(g)                                  Expenses, attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in such binding arbitration shall be the obligation of and paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses.
The parties shall
I-19
share equally all expenses of JAMS (including those of the arbitrators) incurred in connection with any arbitration.
Any such arbitration shall be subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (b) through (g) above (as if the AAA were JAMS).
Section 6.9.
Reconciliation.
In the event that the Company and Stockholders’ Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to the matters governed by Section 2.1, Section 2.2, Section 3.1, Section 4.3 or Section 4.4 within the relevant period designated in this Agreement (“Reconciliation Dispute”), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a partner or principal in a nationally recognized accounting or law firm (the “Expert”) in the particular area of disagreement mutually acceptable to both parties.
Unless the Company and the Stockholders’ Representative agree otherwise, the Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any material relationship with PubCo, Parent, the Company, the Stockholders’ Representative or other actual or potential conflict of interest.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Expert shall determine only those matters that are in a Reconciliation Dispute and the Expert’s determination will be based upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is the subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, the undisputed amount shall be paid as prescribed by this Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by the Company, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution.
The costs and expenses relating to the engagement of such Expert or amending any Tax Return shall be borne by the Company except as provided in the next sentence.
The Company and the Stockholders’ Representative shall bear their own costs and expenses of such proceeding, unless (i) the Expert adopts the Stockholders’ Representative’s position, in which case the Company shall reimburse the Stockholders’ Representative for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in such proceeding, or (ii) the Expert adopts the Company’s position, in which case the Stockholders’ Representative shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in such proceeding.
Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section 6.9 shall be decided by the Expert.
The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall be binding on the Company and the Stockholders’ Representative and may be entered and enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction.
The determination by the Expert will be based solely on presentations with respect to such disputed items by the Company and in deciding any matter,
I-20
the Expert (i) will be bound by the provisions of this Section 6.9, and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either the Company or the Stockholders’ Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the Company or the Stockholders’ Representative.
Section 6.10.
Withholding.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company or its withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or foreign tax law.
Compensatory payments in respect of any of the Cash Settled Options, Rollover Options or RSUs of the Sellers shall be paid through the Company’s payroll procedures and subject to applicable employment taxes.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholders’ Representative for the benefit of the Sellers.
Section 6.11.
Consolidated Group Matters; Transfers of Corporate Assets.
(a)                                 If PubCo, Parent or the Company becomes a member of an affiliated or consolidated group of corporations (other than the current affiliated or consolidated group of which PubCo is the parent) that files a consolidated income tax return pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq.
of the Code (the “New Tax Group”): (i) the provisions of this Agreement relating to Parent, PubCo, the Company or the existing Tax Group shall be applied with respect to the New Tax Group as a whole; (ii) Tax Benefit Payments shall be computed with reference to the consolidated taxable income of the New Tax Group as a whole; and (iii) any net operating losses of the New Tax Group shall not be included when calculating Modified Tax Liability and Hypothetical Tax Liability under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein, if PubCo, Parent or the Company become a member of a New Tax Group as a result of a Change of Control, the provisions of Articles III and IV shall control.
(b)                                 If any Person the income of which is included in the income of PubCo and its Subsidiaries (or New Tax Group, as applicable) transfers one or more assets to a corporation (or any Person treated as such for Tax purposes) with which such entity does not file a consolidated tax return pursuant to Section 1501 of the Code, for purposes of calculating the amount of any Tax Benefit Payment (e.g., calculating the gross income of the Company’s affiliated or consolidated group and determining the Realized Tax Benefit) due hereunder, such Person shall be treated as having disposed of such asset in a fully taxable transaction on the date of such transfer.
For purposes of this Section 6.11(b), the consideration deemed to be received by such entity shall be equal to the fair market value of the transferred asset.
Section 6.12.
Actions of the Stockholders’ Representative.
For the purposes of this Agreement, any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller, and the Company may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders’ Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Seller.
Section 9.14 (Stockholders’ Representative) of the Merger Agreement applies to this Agreement mutatis mutandis.

Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.
(b)                                 Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders.

(c)                                  Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions (payable in cash, property or capital stock of the Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and shall share equally on a per share basis in such dividends and distributions.

ARTICLE V
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Section 5.1                                    Board Powers.
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board.
In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (“Bylaws”), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject,
J-2
nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.
Section 5.2                                    Number, Election and Term.
(b)                                 Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III.
The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate.
At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal.
Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an annual meeting of stockholders by holders of the Common Stock.
The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL and the Director Nomination Agreements.
(d)                                 Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the election of directors need not be by written ballot.
Section 5.3                                    Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies.
Subject to Section 5.5 hereof and except as otherwise set forth in the Director Nomination Agreements, newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which the new directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director’s earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.
Section 5.4                                    Removal.
Subject to Section 5.5 hereof and except as otherwise set forth in the Director Nomination Agreements, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
Section 5.5                                    Preferred Stock - Directors.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the
J-3
right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.
ARTICLE VI
BYLAWS
In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.
The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.
Section 7.1                                    Meetings.
Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President of the Corporation, the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and the ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting is hereby specifically denied.
Except as provided in the foregoing sentence, special meetings of stockholders may not be called by another person or persons.
Section 7.2                                    Advance Notice.
Section 7.3                                    Action by Written Consent.
Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.
ARTICLE VIII
 LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION
Section 8.1                                    Limitation of Director Liability.
A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended unless they violated their duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from their actions as directors.
Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.
J-4
Section 8.2                                    Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
(a)                                 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “proceeding”) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an “indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding.
The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 8.2 or otherwise.
Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board deems appropriate.
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Section 8.2 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2(a), except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
(b)                                 The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
(c)                                  Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.
(d)                                 This Section 8.2 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.
Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2 and who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board.
(e)                                  Notwithstanding that an indemnitee may have certain rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses provided by other persons (collectively, the “Other Indemnitors”), with respect to the rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses set forth herein, the Corporation: (i) shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such indemnitee are secondary); and (ii) shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all liabilities, without
J-5
regard to any rights such indemnitee may have against any of the Other Indemnitors.
No advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee with respect to any claim for which such indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the immediately preceding sentence, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such indemnitee against the Corporation.
(f)                                   For purposes of this Section 8.2, references to the “Corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Section 8.2 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
ARTICLE IX
 CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY
Section 9.1                                    Corporate Opportunity.
(a)                                 The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future.
In addition to the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall renounce its interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer and (ii) the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.
(b)                                 Without limiting the foregoing, none of the directors, officers, employees or representatives of IPC or THL Agiliti (each an “Exempted Person”) nor their respective affiliates shall have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as the Corporation and no Exempted Person nor their respective affiliates (except as provided in the second sentence of paragraph (a) above) shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of any such activities of such Exempted Person or any of their respective affiliates.
In the event that an Exempted Person or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for itself and the Corporation, no Exempted Person nor any of their respective affiliates shall have any duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to the Corporation and shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder of the Corporation solely by reason of the fact that an Exempted Person or any of their respective affiliates pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself, directs such corporate opportunity to another person, or does not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation.
(c)                                  In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article IX, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to belong to the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that the Corporation is not financially able or contractually permitted or legally able to undertake, or that is, from its nature, not in the line of the Corporation’s business or is of no practical advantage to it or that is one in which the Corporation has no interest or reasonable expectancy.
(d)                                 Except as provided in the second sentence of paragraph (a) above, if a director or officer of the Corporation who is also a director, officer, employee or representative of an Exempted Person or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a
J-6
corporate opportunity, the Corporation shall have no interest in such corporate opportunity and no expectancy that such corporate opportunity be offered to it, any such interest or expectancy being hereby renounced, so that such person shall have no duty to present such corporate opportunity to the Corporation and shall have the right to hold and exploit any such corporate opportunity for its (and its officers’, employees’, directors’, agents’, stockholders’, members’, partners’, affiliates’ or subsidiaries’) own account or to direct, sell, assign or transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than the Corporation.
Such person shall not breach any fiduciary duty to the Corporation or to its stockholders by reason of the fact that such person does not present such corporate opportunity to the Corporation or pursues, acquires or exploits such corporate opportunity for itself or directs, sells, assigns or transfers such corporate opportunity to another person.
Section 9.2                                    Deemed Notice.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Article IX.
Section 9.3                                    Severability.
To the extent that any provision or part of any provision of this Article IX is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision or part of any other provision of this Article IX.
ARTICLE X
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(b) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) those shares owned by (i) persons who are directors and also officers or (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or

For the purpose of determining whether a person is an interested stockholder, the voting stock of the Corporation deemed to be outstanding shall include stock deemed to be owned by the person through application of the definition of “owner” below but shall not include any other unissued stock of the Corporation which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

(iii) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or consent as described in item (B) of subsection (ii) above), or disposing of such stock with any other person that beneficially owns, or whose Affiliates or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, such stock.

ARTICLE II
STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS
Section 2.1                                   Annual Meetings.
The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and time and on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 9.5(a).
At each annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters shall elect those directors of the Corporation to fill any term of a directorship that expires on the date of such annual meeting and may transact any other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
Section 2.2                                   Special Meetings.
Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock and to the requirements of applicable law, special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and may not be called by any other person.
Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and at such time and on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the Corporation’s notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 9.5(a).
Section 2.3                                   Notices.
If said notice is for a stockholders meeting other than an annual meeting, it shall in addition state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and the business transacted at such meeting shall be limited to the matters so stated in the Corporation’s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto).
Any meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given may be postponed, and any meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given may be cancelled, by the Board upon public announcement (as defined in Section 2.7(c)) given before the date previously scheduled for such meeting.
Section 2.4                                   Quorum.
Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Corporation’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as the same may be further amended or restated from time to time, the
K-1
“Certificate of Incorporation”) or these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy, at a stockholders meeting of the holders of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting, except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or series of stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction of such business.
If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.6 until a quorum shall attend.
The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Section 2.5                                   Voting of Shares.
(a)                                 Voting Lists.
Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(a) shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.
In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation.
If a meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote communication as permitted by Section 9.5(a), the list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of meeting.
The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list required by this Section 2.5(a) or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
(b)                                 Manner of Voting.
At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy.
If authorized by the Board, the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission (as defined in Section 9.3), provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder.
The Board, in its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders, in such person’s discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
(c)                                  Proxies.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, if permitted by the Certificate of Incorporation, may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority.
(i)                                     A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy.
Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder’s authorized
K-2
officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person’s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
(ii)                                  A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
(d)                                 Required Vote.
Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of preferred stock of the Corporation (“Preferred Stock”), voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at all meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
All other matters presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different vote is required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter.
(e)                                  Inspectors of Election.
The Board may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.
The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.
If no inspectors of election or alternates are appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.
Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.
The inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of outstanding shares and the voting power of each; determine the number of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots.
No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors.
Section 2.6                                   Adjournments.
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting, from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place.
Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.
At the adjourned meeting the stockholders, or the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to vote separately as a class, as the case may be, may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.

Section 2.7                                   Advance Notice for Business.

No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (i) specified in the Corporation’s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation (x) who is a stockholder of record entitled to vote at such annual meeting on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.7(a) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (y) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.7(a).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.7(a) to the contrary, only persons nominated for election as a director to fill any term of a directorship that expires on the date of the annual meeting pursuant to Section 3.2 will be considered for election at such meeting.
(i)                                     In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business (other than nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action.
The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting shall not commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described in this Section 2.7(a).
(iii)                               The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.7(a) shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than nominations) if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such stockholder’s intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and such stockholder has complied with the requirements of such Rule for inclusion of such proposal in a proxy statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting.
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.7(a), provided, however, that once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.7(a) shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business.
If the Board or the chairman of the annual meeting determines that any stockholder proposal was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.7(a) or that the information provided in a stockholder’s notice does not satisfy the information requirements of this Section 2.7(a), such proposal shall not be
K-4
presented for action at the annual meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7(a), if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matter may have been received by the Corporation.
(iv)                              In addition to the provisions of this Section 2.7(a), a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein.
Nothing in this Section 2.7(a) shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
(b)                                 Special Meetings of Stockholders.

INDEMNIFICATION
Section 8.1                                   Right to Indemnification.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnity and hold harmless each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an “Indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 8.3 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
Section 8.2                                   Right to Advancement of Expenses.
In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 8.1, an Indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an “advancement of expenses”); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the Corporation’s receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an “undertaking”), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise.
Section 8.3                                   Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit.
Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under Section 8.1 or advancement of expenses under Section 8.2 shall be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days for an indemnification claim under Section 8.1 and within 20 days for advancement of expenses under Section 8.2, upon the written request of the director or officer.
If a determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved the request.
If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.
In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a “final adjudication”) that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the
K-13
circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, shall be a defense to such suit.
In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Section 8.4                                   Non-Exclusivity of Rights.

Section 8.5                                   Insurance.
The Corporation may secure insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
Section 8.6                                   Indemnitor of First Resort.
Notwithstanding that an indemnitee may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by other persons (collectively, the “Other Indemnitors”), with respect to the rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance set forth herein, the Corporation: (i) shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such indemnitee are secondary); and (ii) shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all liabilities, without regard to any rights such indemnitee may have against any of the Other Indemnitors.
No advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee with respect to any claim for which such indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the immediately preceding sentence, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such indemnitee against the Corporation.

If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2(a) at the adjourned meeting.
(b)                                 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action.
