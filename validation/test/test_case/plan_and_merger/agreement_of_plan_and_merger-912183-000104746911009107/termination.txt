(ii)           if the Acceptance Time has not occurred by the date that is four (4) months after the date hereof (the “Outside Date”); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur by such date; or
(c)           By Parent if, (i) there has been a breach by the Company of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement (A) which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in clause (c) or (d) of Annex I and (B) such breach or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured; or (ii) due to an occurrence or circumstance that has resulted in a failure to satisfy any Offer Condition that is not capable of being cured, Sub shall have allowed the Offer to terminate, without having accepted any Shares for payment, unless such occurrence or circumstance shall have been caused by or resulted from the failure of Parent or Sub to perform, in any material respect, any of their covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or the breach by Parent or Sub of any of their representations or warranties contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if Parent is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or
(d)           By the Company if, prior to the Acceptance Time, there has been a breach by Parent or Sub of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or inaccuracy is reasonably expected to prevent Parent or Sub from performing in all material respects its obligations and covenants required to be performed by it under this Agreement (and such breach or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured); provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or
(e)           By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company Board of Directors shall have (A) effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) recommended to the Company’s stockholders an Acquisition Proposal, or publicly announced its intention to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (C) failed to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement or the Offer within two (2) business days of Parent’s request, or (D) failed to recommend against, or taken a neutral position with respect to, a tender or exchange offer related to an Acquisition Proposal in any position taken pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act; or

(b)           If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the Company shall promptly pay Parent a termination fee (the “Termination Fee”) of $10,000,000, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the date of receipt of Parent’s termination notice.
If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), it shall, in connection with and as a condition to such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee.
If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) due to the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition or 8.1(c)(i) due to a material breach of Section 5.2, or if the Company terminates pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), and in each case at or prior to the time of termination an Acquisition Proposal has been made (and, with regard to any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), such Acquisition Proposal has been publicly made), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee upon signing a definitive agreement for a transaction relating to an Acquisition Proposal (or, if earlier, the consummation of a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal), provided such signing (or, if earlier, such consummation) occurs within nine (9) months of the termination date.
