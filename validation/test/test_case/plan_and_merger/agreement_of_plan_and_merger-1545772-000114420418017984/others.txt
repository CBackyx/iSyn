The holders of Class A Stock, Class B Stock, Class C Stock and Common Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends from the Corporation as follows:(a) Each Class A Shareholder, with respect to a Class A Share, subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes and series of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of any assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, the Class A Dividend.
If the full amount of the Class A Dividend is not declared and paid on such dividend payment date, then the Class A Dividend shall accrue and accumulate, whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment thereof and whether or not such distributions are earned, declared or authorized.
The record and payment dates for the dividends or other distributions upon the shares of Class A Stock, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, shall be the same as the record and payment dates for the dividends or other distributions upon the BPY Units.
If, in connection with the exercise of any Class A Shareholder’s Exchange Right, such Tendering Class A Shareholder has not received with respect to its Tendered Class A Shares an amount equal to the Cash Amount to which such Tendering Class A Shareholder is entitled pursuant to subsection C(3) (or, pursuant to subsection C(3)(b), the BPY Units Amount or the Secondary Exchange Amount), then payment in full of such amount shall be prior and in preference to any dividend or distributions on the Class A Stock, Class B Stock, Class C Stock and Common Stock.
In addition, if applicable in connection with an adjustment to the Conversion Factor pursuant to clauses (3)(A), (3)(B) or (4) of the definition thereof, the Class A Shareholders do not receive, in respect of each share of Class A Stock, the cash amount pursuant to the last paragraph of such clause (3)(A) or such clause (4) or the proviso in the first paragraph of such clause (3)(B), as the case may be, then payment in full of such cash amount shall be prior and in preference to any 17
dividend or distributions on the Class A Stock, Class B Stock, Class C Stock and Common Stock.
All Class A Dividends shall be paid prior and in preference to any dividends or distributions on the Class B Stock, Class C Stock or the Common Stock and shall be fully declared and paid before any dividends are declared and paid or any other distributions are made on any Class B Stock, Class C Stock or the Common Stock.
The holders of Class A Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends from the Corporation other than the Class A Dividend.
Dividends upon the shares of Class B Stock shall only be paid when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors; however, dividends on the Class B Stock shall accumulate whether or not so declared.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, dividends on the Class B Stock may be paid by an in-kind distribution of additional shares of Class B Stock, with a liquidation preference equal to the Class B Liquidation Amount, or any other class of shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Class A Stock.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and except for distributions to the holders of shares of the Class B Stock in shares of any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Class A Stock, the holders of shares of the Class B Stock, as a separate class, shall not be entitled to receive dividends, redemptions or other distributions (payable in cash, assets, property or Capital Stock of the Corporation or otherwise), and no dividends or distributions on the Class B Stock shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment, and no other transfer or distribution of cash, assets or other property may be declared or made, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to, any shares of Class B Stock for any period, nor shall any shares of Class B Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (payable in cash, assets, property or Capital Stock of the Corporation or otherwise), nor shall any funds be paid or made available for a 18
sinking fund for the redemption of such shares of Class B Stock, and no other transfer or distribution of cash, assets or other property may be made, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to any shares of Class B Stock by the Corporation, (i) unless and until (A) the Corporation has paid, with respect to each outstanding Class A Share, the aggregate Class A Dividend in the then current dividend period and for any prior dividend periods beginning on the date of issuance of such Class A Share and (B) the Dividend Coverage Ratio is equal to or greater than 1.25:1, (ii) if, in connection with the exercise of any Class A Shareholder’s Exchange Right, such Tendering Class A Shareholder has not received with respect to its Tendered Class A Shares an amount equal to the Cash Amount to which such Tendering Class A Shareholder is entitled pursuant to subsection C(3) (or, pursuant to subsection C(3)(b), the BPY Units Amount or the Secondary Exchange Amount) or (iii) if applicable in connection with an adjustment to the Conversion Factor pursuant to clauses (3)(A), (3)(B) or (4) of the definition thereof, the Class A Shareholders have not received, in respect of each share of Class A Stock, the cash amount pursuant to the last paragraph of such clause (3)(A) or such clause (4) or the proviso in the first paragraph of such clause (3)(B), as the case may be.
The Corporation shall not declare dividends, redemptions or other distributions on the Class B Stock, or pay or set apart for payment of dividends, redemptions or other distributions on the Class B Stock, if the terms of any of the agreements of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to the indebtedness of the Corporation, prohibit such a declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provide that such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach of or default under such an agreement.
Likewise, no dividends, redemptions or other distributions on the Class B Stock shall be declared by the Board of Directors or paid or set apart for payment if such declaration or payment is restricted or prohibited by law.
Dividends on the Class B Stock shall accrue and accumulate, however, whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of dividends and whether or not such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors.
When full cumulative dividends are not paid (or the Corporation does not set apart a sum sufficient to pay in full cumulative dividends for all past dividend periods and the current dividend period) upon the Class B Stock and the shares of any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking on parity as to dividend rights with the Class B Stock, all dividends declared upon the Class B Stock and any other class or series of stock ranking on parity as to dividend rights with the Class B Stock shall be declared pro rata, so that the ratio of the amount of dividends declared per share of the Class B Stock bearing to that of such other class or series of stock of the Corporation will in all cases be the same as the ratio of the accumulated dividends per share of the Class B Stock bearing to that of such other class or series of stock (which will not include any accrual or accumulation in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such other class or series of stock does not have a cumulative dividend).
Holders of shares of the Class B Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend or other distribution, whether payable in cash, 19
assets, property, or Capital Stock of the Corporation or otherwise, in each case, if such dividend or distribution would be in excess of the full cumulative dividends on the Class B Stock to which they are entitled.
(c) Holders of Class C Stock and holders of Common Stock, subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes and series of stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends (including the holders of Class A Stock and the holders of Class B Stock), shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of any assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of shares of the Class C Stock, as a separate class, shall not be entitled to receive dividends, redemptions or other distributions (payable in cash, assets, property or Capital Stock of the Corporation or otherwise) (i) unless and until (A) the Corporation has paid, with respect to each outstanding Class A Share, the aggregate Class A Dividend in the then current dividend period and for any prior dividend periods beginning on the date of issuance of such Class A Share and (B) the Dividend Coverage Ratio is equal to or greater than 1.25:1, (ii) if, in connection with the exercise of any Class A Shareholder’s Exchange Right, such Tendering Class A Shareholder has not received with respect to its Tendered Class A Shares an amount equal to the Cash Amount to which such Tendering Class A Shareholder is entitled pursuant to subsection C(3) (or, pursuant to subsection C(3)(b), the BPY Units Amount or the Secondary Exchange Amount), (iii) if applicable in connection with an adjustment to the Conversion Factor pursuant to clauses (3)(A), (3)(B) or (4) of the definition thereof, the Class A Shareholders have not received, in respect of each share of Class A Stock, the cash amount pursuant to the last paragraph of such clause (3)(A) or such clause (4) or the proviso in the first paragraph of such clause (3)(B), as the case may be, or (iv) the full cumulative dividends on the Class B Stock for all past dividend period and the then current dividend period shall have been or contemporaneously are (A) declared and paid in cash or (B) declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set apart for such payment.

(c) To the extent that the Required Funds are raised pursuant to Section 4.3(a)(ii), the General Partner shall, on the Funding Date, contribute to the Partnership, either directly or indirectly (i.e., through an Affiliate), as an additional Capital Contribution the amount of the Required Funds so raised (“Contributed Funds”).
In the event the General Partner and/or an Affiliate of the General Partner advances Required Funds to the Partnership as Contributed Funds pursuant to this subparagraph (c), the Partnership shall assume and pay (or reflect on its books as additional Contributed Funds) the expenses (including any applicable underwriting discounts) incurred by the REIT Entities or the Affiliate Entities in connection with raising such Contributed Funds through a public offering of its securities or otherwise; provided that, to the extent such Required Funds are contributed to Nimbus and/or GGP LP, as applicable, shall assume and pay (or reflect on its books as additional contributions) such expenses.

Each Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold or pay on behalf of or with respect to such Partner any amount of federal, state, local or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines the Partnership is required to withhold or pay with respect to any amount distributable or allocable to such Partner pursuant to 26
this Agreement, including without limitation any taxes required to be withheld or paid by the Partnership pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 or 1446 of the Code.
To the extent any withholding payment is made from funds withheld upon a distribution, the amount of such withholding payment will be treated as distributed to such Partners for all purposes of this Agreement.
Any amount paid on behalf of or with respect to a partner, with respect to any distribution to a Partner on which the Partnership did not withhold or with respect to any Partner’s allocable share of income of the Partnership, shall constitute a loan by the Partnership to such Partner, which loan shall be due within fifteen (15) days after repayment is demanded of such Partner and shall be repaid through withholding of subsequent distributions to such Partner.
Nothing in this Section 5.8 shall create any obligation on the General Partner to advance funds to the Partnership or to borrow funds in order to make payments on account of any liability of the Partnership under a withholding tax act.
To the extent the payment or accrual of withholding tax results in a federal, state or local tax credit to the Partnership, such credit shall be allocated to the Partner to whose distribution the tax is attributable.5.9 Distributions with Respect to Preferred Units.
(i) The holders of Series K Preferred Units are entitled to quarterly, cumulative partnership distributions when, if and as declared, as more particularly described in Schedule J.
In the event that Nimbus or GGP LP distributes shares of Common Stock to the holders of its common units (or effectuates a pro rata redemption of its common units in exchange for shares of Common Stock) and a portion of such shares are directly or indirectly received by the Public REIT and thereby canceled, then the General Partner shall have the right, without the consent of any other Partners, to cause the Partnership to redeem Common Units from all holders on a pro rata basis in exchange for any or all shares of Common Stock that the Partnership receives in such distribution.
Any such redemption shall be pro rata from all holders of Common Units based on the number of Common Units held by each holder, provided that the General Partner may make such adjustments as are necessary in order to avoid being required to transfer fractions of a share of Common Stock in connection with any such redemption.ARTICLE VIRights, Duties and Restrictions of the General Partner6.1 Expenditures by Partnership.

Upon such transfer, the transferee shall be admitted as a substituted limited partner as such term is defined in the Act (the “Substituted Limited Partner”) and shall succeed to all of the rights of the transferor Limited Partner under this Agreement in the place and stead of such transferor Limited Partner; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any transferee of any transferred Units, to the extent such transferee is entitled to exercise Rights under the Rights Agreement, shall be subject to any and all ownership limitations contained in the Charter which may limit or restrict such transferee’s ability to exercise the Rights.
Any transferee, whether or not admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, shall take subject to the obligations of the transferor hereunder.
Unless admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, no transferee, whether by a voluntary transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, shall have rights hereunder, other than to receive such portion of the distributions made by the Partnership as are allocable to the Units transferred.8.3 Issuance of Additional Common Units.

§ 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended or (viii) if such transfer is effectuated through an “established securities market” or “secondary market” (or the substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or such transfer causes the Partnership to become a “publicly traded partnership” as such term is defined in Section 7704(b) of the Code.

Upon the issuance of any LTIP Units by the Partnership, the General Partner shall cause one or more of the Property Partnerships to issue additional interests to the Partnership on terms that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the applicable LTIP Units so that the Partnership will receive additional distributions and other rights in respect of the Property Partnerships equivalent to those to which the recipient of the LTIP Units is entitled in respect of the Partnership.
The General Partner’s determination that the consideration is adequate shall be conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration relates to whether the partnership interests are validly issued and paid.
The General Partner shall be authorized on behalf of each of the Partners to amend this Agreement to reflect the admission of any Additional Partner in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.5 in the event that the General Partner deems such amendment to be desirable.

The Limited Partners and their Affiliates may engage in or possess an interest in any other business or venture of any kind, independently or with others, on their own behalf or on behalf of other entities with which they are affiliated or associated, and such persons may engage in any activities, whether or not competitive with the Partnership, without any obligation to offer any interest in such activities to the Partnership or to any Partner.
Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall have any right, by virtue of this Agreement, in or to such activities, or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of such activities, even if competitive with the business of the Partnership, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper.ARTICLE X [Intentionally Omitted]ARTICLE XI [Intentionally Omitted]ARTICLE XIIArbitration of Disputes12.1 Arbitration.

An adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (i) shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day next following the record date (except as provided in subsection (g) below) in the case of a distribution and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day next following the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.
In determining whether any-rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of Common Units to subscribe for or purchase Common Units at less than the Fair Market Value, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Partnership upon issuance and upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of the General Partner.

(iv) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require a cumulative increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments that by reason of this subsection (iv) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment until made; and provided, further, that any adjustment shall be required and made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7 (other than this subsection (iv)) not later than such time as may be required in order to preserve the tax-free nature of a distribution to the holders of Common Units.

Anything in this subsection (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Partnership shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by law, to make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this subsection (c), as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any Unit distributions, subdivision of Units, reclassification or combination of Units, distribution of rights, options or warrants to purchase Units or securities, or a distribution consisting of other assets (other than cash distributions) hereafter made by the Partnership to its holders of Units shall not be taxable but any such adjustment shall not adversely affect the value of the Series B Preferred Units.

stock, securities or other property in connection with such Transaction shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares, stock, securities and other property (including cash or any combination thereof) receivable upon the consummation of such Transaction by a holder of that number of Common Units into which one Series B Preferred Unit was convertible immediately prior to such Transaction, assuming such holder of Common Units is not a Person with which the Partnership consolidated or into which the Partnership merged or which merged into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a “Constituent Person”), or an affiliate of a Constituent Person.
The Partnership shall not be a party to any Transaction unless the terms of such Transaction are consistent with the provisions of this subsection (d), and it shall not consent or agree to the occurrence of any Transaction until the Partnership has entered into an agreement with the successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit of the holders of the Series B Preferred Units that will contain provisions enabling the holders of Series B Preferred Units that remain outstanding after such Transaction to convert into the consideration received by holders of Common Units at the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such Transaction (with the holder having the option to elect the type of consideration if a choice was offered in the Transaction).
The provisions of this subsection (d) shall similarly apply to successive Transactions.

Failure to give or receive such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the proceedings described in this Section 7.
(g) In any case in which subsection (c) of this Section 7 provides that an adjustment shall become effective on the date next following the record date for an event, the Partnership may defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any Series B Preferred Unit converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional Common Units issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the Common Units issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment.
(h) For purposes of this Section 7, the number of Common Units at any time outstanding shall not include any Common Units then owned or held by or for the account of the Partnership.
The Partnership shall not make any distribution on Common Units held in the treasury of the Partnership.
(i) If any action or transaction would require adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to more than one subsection of this Section 7, only one adjustment shall be made, and such adjustment shall be the amount of adjustment that has the highest absolute value.
(j) If the Partnership shall take any action affecting the Common Units, other than action described in this Section 7, that in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner would materially and adversely affect the conversion rights of the holders of the Series B Preferred Units, the Conversion Price for the Series B Preferred Units may be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, in such manner, if any, and at such time, as the General Partner determines to be equitable in the circumstances.
(k) The Partnership covenants that Common Units issued upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Units shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and the holder thereof shall be entitled to rights of a holder of Common Units specified in the Partnership Agreement.
Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Partnership shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Units, the Partnership shall endeavor to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof, by any governmental authority.
(l) The Partnership will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of Common Units or other securities or property on conversion of the Series B Preferred Units pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any A-11
transfer involved in the issue or delivery of Common Units or other securities or property in a name other than that of the holder of the Series B Preferred Units to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the Partnership the amount of any such tax or established, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Partnership, that such tax has been paid.

(j) If, for any taxable year, the Partnership elects to designate as “capital gain dividends” (as defined in Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any successor revenue code or section) any portion of the total distributions (as determined for Federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all partnership interests of the Partnership (the “Capital Gains Amount”), then the portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of the Series I Preferred Units shall be in the same portion that the total distributions paid or made available to the holders of the Series I Preferred Units for the year bears to the total distributions for the year made with respect to all partnership interests in the Partnership.

G-6
SCHEDULE H1.1 Designation.
A class of Partnership Units in the Partnership designated as “LTIP Units” is hereby established.
LTIP Units are intended to qualify as “profits interests” in the Partnership.
Two initial series of LTIP Units designated as “AO LTIP Units” and “FV LTIP Units,” respectively, are hereby established.
The number of LTIP Units, AO LTIP Units and FV LTIP Units that may be issued by the Partnership shall not be limited.1.2 Vesting.
LTIP Units may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, be issued subject to vesting, forfeiture and additional restrictions on transfer pursuant to the terms of an award, vesting or other similar agreement (a “Vesting Agreement”).
The terms of any Vesting Agreement may be modified by the General Partner from time to time in its sole discretion, subject to any restrictions on amendment imposed by the relevant Vesting Agreement or by the terms of any Stock Plan pursuant to which the LTIP Units are issued, if applicable.
LTIP Units that have vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture under the terms of a Vesting Agreement are referred to as “Vested LTIP Units;” all other LTIP Units are referred to as “Unvested LTIP Units.”1.3 Forfeiture or Transfer of Unvested LTIP Units.
Unless otherwise specified in the relevant Vesting Agreement, no consideration or other payment shall be due with respect to any LTIP Units that have been forfeited, other than any distributions declared with a record date prior to the effective date of the forfeiture.1.4 Legend.
Any certificate evidencing an LTIP Unit shall bear an appropriate legend indicating that additional terms, conditions and restrictions on transfer, including without limitation provisions set forth in the Vesting Agreement, apply to the LTIP Unit.1.7.
Adjustments.
If an LTIP Unit Adjustment Event (as defined below) occurs, then the General Partner shall make a corresponding adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain the same correspondence between Series K Preferred Units and LTIP Units as existed prior to such LTIP Unit Adjustment Event.
The following shall be “LTIP Unit Adjustment Events:” (A) the Partnership makes a distribution on all outstanding Series K Preferred Units in Units, (B) the Partnership subdivides the outstanding Series K Preferred Units into a greater number of Units or combines the outstanding Series K Preferred Units into a smaller number of Units, or (C) the Partnership issues any Units in exchange for its outstanding Series K Preferred Units by way of a reclassification or recapitalization.
If more than one LTIP Unit Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the LTIP Units need be made only once using a single formula that takes into account each and every LTIP Unit Adjustment Event as if all LTIP Unit Adjustment Events
occurred simultaneously.
If the Partnership takes an action affecting the Series K Preferred Units other than actions specifically described above as LTIP Unit Adjustment Events and in the opinion of the General Partner such action would require an adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain the correspondence between Series K Preferred Units and LTIP Units as it existed prior to such action, the General Partner shall make such adjustment to the LTIP Units, to the extent permitted by law and by the terms of any Vesting Agreement or plan pursuant to which the LTIP Units have been issued, in such manner and at such time as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances to maintain such correspondence.
H-3
Agreement.
To the extent the Partnership pays any special distribution on the Series K Preferred Units (i.e., a distribution corresponding to a special distribution on the BPY Units) on or after the date hereof, the General Partner shall adjust the AO LTIP Adjustment Factor for each AO LTIP Unit in such manner as it determines, in its sole discretion, is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of such AO LTIP Unit.“AO LTIP Conversion Factor” shall mean the quotient of (i) the excess of (A) the Conversion Date Value (as defined below) multiplied by the AO LTIP Adjustment Factor over (B) the AO LTIP Unit Participation Threshold (as defined below) for such Vested AO LTIP Unit, divided by (ii) the Conversion Date Value.“AO LTIP Unit Participation Threshold” shall mean, for each AO LTIP Unit, the amount specified as such in the relevant Vesting Agreement or other documentation pursuant to which such AO LTIP Unit is granted.
Each holder of LTIP Units covenants and agrees with the Partnership that all Vested LTIP Units to be converted pursuant to this Section 1.8 shall be free and clear of all liens.
H-4
1.9 Forced Conversion by the Partnership into Common Units.
A Forced LTIP Unit Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner in which notices are generally to be provided in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.
Each holder of LTIP Units covenants and agrees with the Partnership that all Vested LTIP Units to be converted pursuant to this Section 1.9 shall be free and clear of all liens.1.10 Conversion Procedures.
H-5
1.11 Treatment of Capital Account.
For purposes of making future allocations under the Partnership Agreement, reference to a Partner’s portion of its Economic Capital Account Balance attributable to his or her LTIP Units shall exclude, after the date of conversion of any of its LTIP Units, the portion of such Partner’s Economic Capital Account Balance attributable to the converted LTIP Units.1.12 Mandatory Conversion in Connection with a Capital Transaction.
(a) If the Partnership, the General Partner or the Public REIT shall be a party to any transaction (including without limitation a merger, consolidation, unit exchange, self tender offer for all or substantially all Series K Preferred Units or other business combination or reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership’s assets, but excluding any transaction which constitutes an LTIP Unit Adjustment Event) as a result of which Series K Preferred Units shall be exchanged for or converted into the right, or the Holders of Series K Preferred Units shall otherwise be entitled, to receive cash, securities or other property or any combination thereof (any such transaction being referred to herein as a “Capital Transaction”), then the General Partner shall, immediately prior to the Capital Transaction, exercise its right to cause an LTIP Unit Forced Conversion with respect to the maximum number of LTIP Units then eligible for conversion, taking into account any allocations that occur in connection with the Capital Transaction or that would occur in connection with the Capital Transaction if the assets of the Partnership were sold at the Capital Transaction price or, if applicable, at a value determined by the General Partner in good faith using the value attributed to the Series K Preferred Units in the context of the Capital Transaction (in which case the LTIP Unit Conversion Date shall be the effective date of the Capital Transaction and the conversion shall occur immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Capital Transaction).
(b) In anticipation of such LTIP Unit Forced Conversion and the consummation of the Capital Transaction, the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Holder of LTIP Units to be afforded the right to receive in connection with such Capital Transaction in consideration for the Series K Preferred Units into which his or her LTIP Units will be converted the same kind and amount of cash, securities and other property (or any combination thereof) receivable upon the consummation of such Capital Transaction by a Holder of the same number of Series K Preferred Units, assuming such Holder of Series K Preferred Units is not a Person with which the Partnership consolidated or into which the Partnership merged or which merged into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a “Constituent Person”), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person.
In the event that Holders of Series K Preferred Units have the opportunity to elect the form or type of consideration to be received upon consummation of the Capital Transaction, prior H-6
If a Holder of LTIP Units fails to make such an election, such Holder (and any of its transferees) shall receive upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held by him or her (or by any of his or her transferees) the same kind and amount of consideration that a Holder of a Series K Preferred Unit would receive if such holder of Series K Preferred Units failed to make such an election.
(c) Subject to the rights of the Partnership and the General Partner under the relevant Vesting Agreement and the terms of any Stock Plan under which LTIP Units are issued, the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause the terms of any Capital Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of this Section 1.12, and (ii) in the event LTIP Units are not converted into Series K Preferred Units in connection with the Capital Transaction (including pursuant to Section 1.12(a) above), but subject to the rights of the General Partner and the Partnership set forth in Section 1.15(b)(ii) below to the extent that they can act without the consent of Holders of LTIP Units, enter into an agreement with the successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit of those Holders of LTIP Units whose LTIP Units will not be converted into Series K Preferred Units in connection with the Capital Transaction that, to the extent compatible with the interests of the Series K Preferred Unitholders and the shareholders of the Public REIT, (A) contains reasonable provisions designed to allow such Holders to subsequently convert their LTIP Units, if and when eligible for conversion, into securities as comparable as reasonably possible under the circumstances to the Series K Preferred Units, and (B) preserves as far as reasonably possible under the circumstances the distribution, special allocation, conversion, and other rights of such Holders.1.13 Redemption Right of LTIP Unit Limited Partners.
(a) LTIP Units will not be redeemable at the option of the Partnership; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Partnership (i) from repurchasing LTIP Units from the Holder thereof if and to the extent that such Holder agrees to sell such LTIP Units or (ii) from exercising the right to cause a LTIP Unit Forced Conversion.
(b) Except as otherwise set forth in the relevant Vesting Agreement or other separate agreement entered into between the Partnership and a LTIP Unit Limited Partner, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein or in the Partnership Agreement, on or at any time after the applicable LTIP Unit Conversion Date each LTIP Unit Limited Partner will have the right (the “LTIP Unit Redemption Right”) to require the Partnership to redeem all or a portion of H-7
(i) the Series K Preferred Units distributed with respect to such LTIP Unit Limited Partner’s LTIP Units or such LTIP Unit Limited Partner’s Common Units issued on or before the Pre-Closing Distribution upon conversion of Vested LTIP Units or (ii) the Series K Preferred Units into which such LTIP Unit Limited Partner’s LTIP Units (or such LTIP Unit Limited Partner’s Common Units issued on or before the Pre-Closing Distribution upon conversion of Vested LTIP Units that remain outstanding) were converted (such Series K Preferred Units in clauses (i) and (ii) being hereafter referred to as “Tendered Units”) in exchange for the Cash Amount (as defined below), unless the terms of this Agreement, the relevant Vesting Agreement or other separate agreement entered into between the Partnership and the LTIP Unit Limited Partner expressly provide that such Series K Preferred Units are not entitled to the LTIP Unit Redemption Right.
In such event, the Tendering Partner shall have no right to cause the Partnership to redeem such Tendered Units for the Cash Amount.
The term “REIT Shares Amount” shall mean, with respect to Tendered Units as of a particular date, a number of shares of Class A Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the number of Tendered Units divided by (ii) the Class A Conversion Factor in effect on such date.
The Tendering Partner shall submit (i) such information, certification or affidavit as the Public REIT may reasonably require in connection with the application of any applicable ownership limit with respect to shares of Class A Stock to any such acquisition and (ii) such written representations, investment letters, legal opinions or other instruments necessary, H-8
in the Public REIT’s view, to effect compliance with the Securities Act.
The REIT Shares Amount, if applicable, shall be delivered as duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class A Stock and free of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or restriction, other than those provided in the Charter, the Securities Act, relevant state securities or blue sky laws and any applicable agreements with respect to such shares of Class A Stock entered into by the Tendering Partner.
Notwithstanding any delay in such delivery (but subject to Section 1.13(e)), the Tendering Partner shall be deemed the owner of such shares of Class A Stock for all purposes, including without limitation, rights to vote or consent, and receive dividends, as of the Specified LTIP Unit Redemption Date.
In addition, the shares of Class A Stock for which the Tendered Units might be exchanged shall also bear all legends deemed necessary or appropriate by the Public REIT.
Neither any Tendering Partner whose Tendered Units are acquired by the Public REIT pursuant to this Section 1.13(d), any Partner, any assignee or permitted transferee nor any other interested Person shall have any right to require or cause the Public REIT to register, qualify or list any shares of Class A Stock owned or held by such Person with the SEC, with any state securities commissioner, department or agency, under the Securities Act or with any stock exchange, unless subject to a separate written agreement pursuant to which the Public REIT has granted registration or similar rights to any such Person.
(e) Each Tendering Partner covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Tendered Units shall be delivered to the General Partner free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances whatsoever and should any such liens, claims and/or encumbrances exist or arise with respect to such Tendered Units, the General Partner shall be under no obligation to acquire the same.
Each Tendering Partner further agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Tendered Units to the General Partner (or its designee), such Tendering Partner shall assume and pay such transfer tax.
(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.13(b), Section 1.13(c), Section 1.13(d) or any other provision of the Partnership Agreement, a Limited Partner (i) shall not be entitled to effect the LTIP Unit Redemption Right for cash or in exchange for shares of Class A Stock to the extent the ownership of or right to acquire shares of Class A Stock pursuant to such exchange by such Partner on the Specified Redemption Date could cause such Partner or any other Person to violate any of the restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares of Class A Stock set forth in the Charter and (ii) shall have no rights under this Agreement to acquire shares of Class A Stock which would otherwise be prohibited under the Charter.
To the extent any attempted redemption or exchange for shares of Class A Stock would be in violation of this Section 1.13(f), it shall be null and void ab initio and such Limited Partner shall not acquire any rights or economic interest in the cash otherwise payable upon such redemption or the shares of Class A Stock otherwise issuable upon such exchange.
H-9
(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to Section 1.13(f)), with respect to any redemption or exchange for shares of Class A Stock pursuant to this Section 1.13: (i) without the consent of the General Partner otherwise, each Tendering Partner may effect the Redemption Right only one time in each fiscal quarter; (ii) without the consent of the General Partner otherwise, each Limited Partner may not effect the Redemption Right during the period after the record date established in accordance with the Partnership Agreement for the distribution of cash to Series K Preferred Unitholders with respect to a distribution and before the record date established by the Public REIT for a distribution to its holders of Class A Stock of some or all of its portion of such distribution; (iii) the consummation of any redemption or exchange for shares of Class A Stock shall be subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; and (iv) each Tendering Partner shall continue to own all Series K Preferred Units subject to any redemption or exchange for shares of Class A Stock, and be treated as a Limited Partner with respect to such Series K Preferred Units for all purposes of this Agreement, until such Series K Preferred Units are either paid for by the Partnership pursuant to Section 1.13(b) or transferred to the Public REIT and paid for by the issuance of the shares of Class A Stock, pursuant to Section 1.13(d) on the Specified Redemption Date.
Until a Specified Redemption Date, the Tendering Partner shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Public REIT with respect to such Tendering Partner’s Series K Preferred Units.
For clarity, it is noted that the objective of this Section 1.13(h) is to put a holder of LTIP Units in a position where, if he or she so wishes, the Series K Preferred Units into which his or her Vested LTIP Units will be converted can be redeemed by the Partnership simultaneously with such conversion, with the further consequence that, if the Public REIT elects to assume the Partnership’s redemption obligation with respect to such Series K Preferred Units under Section 1.13(d) by delivering to such holder shares of Class A Stock rather than cash, then such holder can have such shares of Class A Stock issued to him or her simultaneously with the conversion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Series K Preferred Units.
The General Partner shall cooperate with a Holder of LTIP Units to coordinate the timing of the different events described in the foregoing sentence.1.14 Voting Rights.
Except as provided in Section 1.15, holders of LTIP Units shall not have the right to vote on any matters submitted to a vote of the Limited Partners.
H-10

The General Partner and/or the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of Holders of more than 50% of the then outstanding LTIP Units affected thereby, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class), take any action that would materially and adversely alter, change, modify or amend, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the rights, powers or privileges of such LTIP Units, subject to the following exceptions: (i) no separate consent of the Holders of LTIP Units will be required if and to the extent that any such alteration, change, modification or amendment would, in a ratable and proportional manner, alter, change, modify or amend the rights, powers or privileges of the Series K Preferred Units; (ii) a merger, consolidation or other business combination or reorganization of the Partnership, the General Partner, the Public REIT or any of their Affiliates shall not be deemed to materially and adversely alter, change, modify or amend the rights, powers or privileges of the LTIP Units so long as either: (w) the LTIP Units that are then eligible for conversion are converted into Series K Preferred Units immediately prior to the effectiveness of the transaction; or (x) the Holders of LTIP Units either will receive, or will have the right to elect to receive, for each LTIP Unit an amount of cash, securities, or other property equal to the amount of cash, securities or other property that would be paid in respect of such LTIP Unit had it been converted into a number of Series K Preferred Units (or fraction of a Series K Preferred Unit, as applicable under the terms of such LTIP Units) immediately prior to the transaction, but only if it was eligible to be so converted; (y) the LTIP Units remain outstanding with their terms materially unchanged; or (z) if the Partnership is not the surviving entity in such transaction, the LTIP Units are exchanged for a security of the surviving entity with terms that are materially the same with respect to rights to allocations, distributions, redemption, conversion and voting as the LTIP Units; (iii) any creation or issuance of Partnership Units (whether ranking junior to, on a parity with or senior to the LTIP Units in any respect), which either (x) does not require the consent of the Holders of Series K Preferred Units or (y) is authorized by the Holders of Series K Preferred Units shall not be deemed to materially and adversely alter, change, modify or amend the rights, powers or privileges of the LTIP Units; and (iv) any waiver by the Partnership of restrictions or limitations applicable to any outstanding LTIP Units with respect to any holder or holders thereof shall not be deemed to materially and adversely alter, change, modify or amend the rights, powers or privileges of the LTIP Units with respect to other holders.
The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, as of or prior to the time when the action with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required will be taken or be effective, all outstanding LTIP Units shall have been converted and/or redeemed, or provision is made for such redemption and/or conversion to occur as of or prior to such time.1.16 Limited Partners’ Rights to Transfer.
(a) Subject to the terms of the relevant Vesting Agreement or other document pursuant to which LTIP Units are granted, except in connection with the exercise of a LTIP Unit Redemption Right pursuant to Section 1.13, a Limited Partner (other than the Company) may not transfer all or any portion of his or her LTIP Units without the prior written consent of the General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the General Partner’s sole and absolute discretion.
H-11
(b) If a holder of LTIP Units is subject to Incapacity, the executor, administrator, trustee, committee, guardian, conservator or receiver of such Limited Partner’s estate shall have all of the rights of a Limited Partner, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other Limited Partners, for the purpose of settling or managing the estate and such power as the Incapacitated Limited Partner possessed to transfer all or any part of his, her or its partnership interest.
“Incapacity” or “Incapacitated” means, (i) as to any LTIP Unit Limited Partner who is an individual, death, total physical disability or entry by a court of competent jurisdiction of an order adjudicating him or her incompetent to manage his or her Person or estate; (ii) as to any Partner that is an estate, the distribution by the fiduciary of the estate of its entire interest in the Partnership; (iii) as to any trustee of a trust which is a LTIP Unit Limited Partner, the termination of the trust (but not the substitution of a new trustee) or (iv) as to any LTIP Unit Limited Partner, the bankruptcy of such LTIP Unit Limited Partner.

Allocation of Net Income and Net Loss.
(a) Net Income.
Except as otherwise provided herein, Operating Income and Liquidating Gain of the Partnership for each fiscal year or other applicable period shall be allocated as follows:1.
First, Operating Income and Liquidating Gain shall be allocated to the General Partner to the extent the cumulative Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to the General Partner under subparagraph (b)(8) below exceeds the cumulative Operating Income and Liquidating Gain allocated to the General Partner under this subparagraph (a)(1), provided that the allocation under this subparagraph shall first be made out of Operating Income to the extent of available Operating Income as of the time any allocation is being made, and thereafter to the extent of any available Liquidating Gain as of such time;2.
Second, Operating Income and Liquidating Gain shall be allocated to each Partner in proportion to and to the extent of the amount by which the cumulative Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to such Partner under subparagraph (b)(7) exceeds the cumulative Operating Income and Liquidating Gain allocated to such Partner under this subparagraph (a)(2), provided that the allocation under this subparagraph shall first be made out of Operating Income to the extent of available Operating Income as of the time any allocation is being made, and thereafter to the extent of any available Liquidating Gain as of such time;3.
Third, Operating Income and Liquidating Gain shall be allocated to the General Partner until the cumulative Operating Income and Liquidating Gain allocated to the General Partner equals the cumulative Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to the General Partner under subparagraph (b)(6), provided that the allocation under this subparagraph shall first be made out of Operating Income to the extent of available Operating Income as of the time any allocation is being made, and thereafter to the extent of any available Liquidating Gain as of such time;4.
Fourth, Operating Income shall be allocated to each holder of Preferred Units other than Series K Preferred Units, Series L Preferred Units and the Series D Preferred Units to the extent of and in proportion to the excess of (I) the cumulative amount of distributions made in respect of such Preferred Units, reduced by in the case of the Series B Preferred Units the cumulative Common Unit Reallocated Amounts, and increased by in the case of the Series B Preferred Units the cumulative Series B Preferred Unit Reallocated Amounts, pursuant to the provisos below, over (II) the cumulative amount of Operating Income allocated to each holder of Preferred Units pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(4) and subparagraph (a)(8) for such period and all prior periods reduced by the cumulative amount of Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to such holder of Preferred Units pursuant to subparagraph (b)(4) below for all prior periods;
provided, however, that in the event the cumulative Operating Income allocable to the holders of the Common Units and holders of LTIP Units pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(4) and subparagraph (a)(6) below for such period and all prior periods (before application of this proviso for such period) exceeds the cumulative distributions made to the holders of Common Units and holders of LTIP Units with respect to such Units for such period and all prior periods, the Series B Preferred Unit Reallocated Amount shall be reallocated pro rata to the holders of Series B Preferred Units;5.
Fifth, Operating Income shall be allocated to each holder of Series K Preferred Units to the extent of and in proportion to the excess of (I) the cumulative amount of distributions made in respect of such Series K Preferred Units, over (II) the cumulative amount of Operating Income allocated to each holder of Series K Preferred Units pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(5) and all prior periods reduced by the cumulative amount of Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to such holder of Series K Preferred Units pursuant to subparagraph (b)(3) below for all prior periods;6.
Sixth, Operating Income shall be allocated to each holder of Series L Preferred Units to the extent of and in proportion to the excess of (I) the cumulative amount of distributions made in respect of such Series L Preferred Units, over (II) the cumulative amount of Operating Income allocated to each holder of Series L Preferred Units pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(6) for such period and all prior periods reduced by the cumulative amount of Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to such holder of Series L Preferred Units pursuant to subparagraph (b)(3) below for all prior periods;7.
Seventh, Operating Income shall be allocated to each holder of LTIP Units to the extent of and in proportion to the excess of (I) the cumulative amount of distributions made in respect of such LTIP Units, over (II) the cumulative amount of Operating Income allocated to each holder of LTIP Units pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(7) for such period and all prior periods reduced by the cumulative amount of Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to such holder of LTIP Units pursuant to subparagraph (b)(2) below for all prior periods; and8.
Thereafter, Operating Income shall be allocated to the holders of Common Units in proportion to the Common Units held by such Partners; provided however that: (i) in the event the cumulative distributions made to the holders of Common Units with respect to such Units for such period and all prior periods exceed the cumulative Operating Income allocable to the holders of the Common Units pursuant to subparagraph (a)(4) and this subparagraph (a)(8) for such period and all prior periods (before application of this proviso for such period), the Common Unit Reallocated Amount shall be reallocated to the holders of Common Units in accordance with their Percentage Interests.The term “Common Unit Reallocated Amount” shall mean an amount equal to the difference between (I) the amount of Operating Income allocable to the Series B Preferred Units pursuant to subparagraph (a)(4) with respect to such fiscal year or other EX B-2
period, and (II) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Percentage Interest represented by the Series B Preferred Units determined as if the Series B Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units, and (B) the sum of (i) the Operating Income allocable to the Series B Preferred Units pursuant to subparagraph (a)(4) with respect to such fiscal year or other period and (ii) the Operating Income allocable to the Common Units pursuant to subparagraph (a)(8) with respect to such fiscal year or other period.
The Common Unit Reallocated Amount shall be calculated based on the amounts of Operating Income allocable under subparagraphs (a)(4) and (a)(8) prior to the application of the provisos contained in such subparagraphs with respect to such fiscal year or other period.The term “Series B Preferred Unit Reallocated Amount” shall mean the difference between (I) the amount of Operating Income allocable to the Common Units and LTIP Units pursuant to subparagraph (a)(8) with respect to such fiscal year or other period, and (II) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Percentage Interest represented by the Common Units (exclusive of the Common Units issuable in respect of the deemed conversion of the Series B Preferred Units as contemplated herein) determined as if the Series B Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units, and (B) the sum of (i) Operating Income allocable to the Series B Preferred Units pursuant to subparagraph (a)(4) with respect to such fiscal year or other period and (ii) the Operating Income allocable to the Common Units pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(8) with respect to such fiscal year or other period; provided, however, that to the extent the allocation of the Series B Preferred Unit Reallocated Amount to the holders of Series B Preferred Units would cause such holders on a cumulative basis to have been allocated Operating Income in excess of distributions, the Series B Preferred Unit Reallocated Amount shall be reduced by such excess.
The Series B Preferred Unit Reallocated Amount shall be calculated based on the amounts of Operating Income allocable pursuant to subparagraphs (a)(4) and (a)(8) prior to the application of the provisos contained in such subparagraphs with respect to such fiscal year or other period.It is the intention of the parties that the application of subparagraphs (a)(4) and (a)(8) above will result in corresponding return of capital distributions (per Unit) to the Series B Preferred Units (on an as-converted basis) and Common Units (based on their respective Percentage Interests) on a cumulative basis and shall be applied and interpreted consistently therewith.In allocating Net Income for each fiscal year or period, for all purposes of this Section 1(a) (including for purposes of determining the “Percentage Interests” of the holders of both the Common Units and the Series D Preferred Units), the holders of the Series D Preferred Units shall be treated as though they held that number of Common Units into which their Series D Preferred Units were convertible, as determined from time to time during such fiscal year or period.
EX B-3
(b) Net Loss.
Except as otherwise provided herein, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss of the Partnership for each fiscal year or other applicable period shall be allocated as follows:1.
First, Operating Loss shall be allocated to the holders of Common Units in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests, and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated to the holders of Common Units in proportion to the Common Units held by such Partners; provided that the Net Loss allocated in respect of a Common Unit pursuant to this Section 1(b)(1) shall not exceed the maximum amount of Net Loss that could be allocated in respect of such Unit without causing a holder of such Unit to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit determined as if the holder held only that Unit (and excluding for this purpose any increase in such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for a holder’s actual obligation to fund a deficit Capital Account balance, including the obligation of an Obligated Partner to fund a deficit Capital Account balance pursuant to Section 7.8 hereof and also excluding for this purpose the balance of such holder’s Capital Account attributable to such holder’s Preferred Units, if any);2.
Second, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated proportionately to the holders of LTIP Units in proportion to each such holder’s Capital Account balance in such LTIP Units, provided that the aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to a holder of LTIP Units pursuant to this Section (b)(2) shall not exceed the maximum amount of aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss that can be allocated without causing any holder of LTIP Units to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (excluding for this purpose any increase to such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for a holder’s actual obligation to fund a deficit Capital Account balance, including the obligation of an Obligated Partner to fund a deficit Capital Account Balance pursuant to Section 7.8 hereof);3.
Third, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated proportionately to the holders of Series L Preferred Units in proportion to each such holder’s Capital Account balance in such Series L Preferred Units, provided that the aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to a holder of Series L Preferred Units pursuant to this Section (b)(3) shall not exceed the maximum amount of aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss that can be allocated without causing any holder of Series L Preferred Units to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (excluding for this purpose any increase to such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for a holder’s actual obligation to fund a deficit Capital Account balance, including the obligation of an Obligated Partner to fund a deficit Capital Account Balance pursuant to Section 7.8 hereof);4.
Fourth, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated proportionately to the holders of Series K Preferred Units in proportion to each such holder’s Capital Account balance in such Series K Preferred Units, provided that the aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to a holder of Series K Preferred Units pursuant to this Section (b)(4) shall not exceed the maximum amount of aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss that can be allocated without causing any holder of Series K Preferred Units to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (excluding for this purpose any increase to such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for a holder’s actual obligation to fund a deficit Capital Account balance, including the obligation of an Obligated Partner to fund a deficit Capital Account Balance pursuant to Section 7.9 hereof); EX B-4
5.
Fifth, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated proportionately to the holders of Preferred Units, other than Series K Preferred Units and Series L Preferred Units, in proportion to each such holder’s Capital Account balance in such Preferred Units, provided that the aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss allocated to a holder of Preferred Units pursuant to this Section (b)(5) shall not exceed the maximum amount of aggregate Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss that can be allocated without causing any holder of Preferred Units to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (excluding for this purpose any increase to such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for a holder’s actual obligation to fund a deficit Capital Account balance, including the obligation of an Obligated Partner to fund a deficit Capital Account Balance pursuant to Section 7.8 hereof);6.
Sixth, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated proportionately to the General Partner, until the General Partner’s Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (excluding for this purpose any increase to such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for the obligation of the General Partner to actually fund a deficit Capital Account balance, including any deemed obligation pursuant to Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c)) equals the excess of (i) the amount of Recourse Liabilities over (ii) the Aggregate Protected Amount;7.
Seventh, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated proportionately to the Obligated Partners, in proportion to their respective Protected Amounts, until such time as the Obligated Partners have been allocated an aggregate amount of Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss pursuant to this subparagraph (b)(7) equal to the Aggregate Protected Amount; and8.
Thereafter, Operating Loss and Liquidating Loss shall be allocated proportionately to the General Partner.2.
Special Allocations.Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph 1 of this Exhibit B, the following special allocations shall be made in the following order:(a) Minimum Gain Chargeback (Nonrecourse Liabilities).
If there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain for any Partnership fiscal year (except as a result of conversion or refinancing of Partnership indebtedness, certain capital contributions or revaluation of the Partnership property as further outlined in Regulation Sections 1.704-2(d)(4), (f)(2) or (f)(3)), each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to that Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain.
The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulation Section 1.704-2(f).
This paragraph (a) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in said section of the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
Allocations pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.
EX B-5
(b) Minimum Gain Attributable to Partner Nonrecourse Debt.
If there is a net decrease in Minimum Gain Attributable to Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any fiscal year (other than due to the conversion, refinancing or other change in the debt instrument causing it to become partially or wholly nonrecourse, certain capital contributions, or certain revaluations of Partnership property as further outlined in Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4)), each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to that Partner’s share of the net decrease in the Minimum Gain Attributable to Partner Nonrecourse Debt.
The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and (j)(2).
This paragraph (b) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement with respect to Partner Nonrecourse Debt contained in said section of the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
Allocations pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.
(c) Qualified Income Offset.
In the event a Limited Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6), and such Limited Partner has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as quickly as possible.
This paragraph (c) is intended to constitute a “qualified income offset” under Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(d) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions.
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any fiscal year or other applicable period shall be specially allocated to the Partner that bears the economic risk of loss for the debt (i.e., the Partner Nonrecourse Debt) in respect of which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable (as determined under Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(4) and (i)(1)).
(e) Allocations With Respect to Preferred Unit Redemptions.
After giving effect to the special allocations set forth above, Net Income of the Partnership shall be allocated to the holders of Preferred Units, at the time of redemption of such Preferred Units (other than in the case of a redemption occurring pursuant to a final liquidation of the Partnership), in an amount equal to the portion of any redemption distribution that exceeds the Liquidation Preference Amount (other than any accrued but unpaid distribution thereon) per Preferred Unit established for such Preferred Unit in the applicable Preferred Unit designation.
The character of the items of Net Income allocated to the holders of Preferred Units pursuant to this subparagraph (e) shall proportionately reflect the relative amounts of the items of Partnership income and gain as determined for federal income tax purposes under Section 703(a) of the Code.
(f) Tax Treatment of Conversion of Preferred Units.
Upon conversion of a Preferred Unit(s) into Common Unit(s), the Company will specially allocate to the converting Partner any Net Income or Net Loss attributable to an adjustment of Gross Asset Values under subparagraph (b) of the definition of “Gross Asset Value” until the portion of such Partner’s Capital Account attributable to each Common Unit received upon conversion equals the Capital Account EX B-6
attributable to a Common Unit at the time of conversion.
To the extent that such allocation is insufficient to bring the portion of the Capital Account attributable to each Common Unit received upon conversion by the converting Partner to the Capital Account attributable to a Common Unit at the time of conversion, a portion of the Capital Account of the non-converting Partners will be shifted, pro rata in accordance with their relative Capital Account balances, to the converted Partner and such transaction shall be treated by the Partnership and the Converting Partner as a transaction defined in Section 721 of the Code.
(g) Curative Allocations.
The Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating other items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among the Partners so that, to the extent possible, the cumulative net amount of allocations of Partnership items under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Exhibit B shall be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each Partner if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.
This subparagraph (i) is intended to minimize to the extent possible and to the extent necessary any economic distortions which may result from application of the Regulatory Allocations and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.
For purposes hereof, “Regulatory Allocations” shall mean the allocations provided under subparagraphs 2(a) through (d).3.
Tax Allocations.
(a) Generally.
Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) hereof, items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to be allocated for income tax purposes (collectively, “Tax Items”) shall be allocated among the Partners on the same basis as their respective book items.
If any portion of gain from the sale of property is treated as gain which is ordinary income by virtue of the application of Code Sections 1245 or 1250 (“Affected Gain”), then (A) such Affected Gain shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportion that the depreciation and amortization deductions giving rise to the Affected Gain were allocated and (B) other Tax Items of gain of the same character that would have been recognized, but for the application of Code Sections 1245 and/or 1250, shall be allocated away from those Partners who are allocated Affected Gain pursuant to Clause (A) so that, to the extent possible, the other Partners are allocated the same amount, and type, of capital gain that would have been allocated to them had Code Sections 1245 and/or 1250 not applied.
For purposes hereof, in order to determine the proportionate allocations of depreciation and amortization deductions for each fiscal year or other applicable period, such deductions shall be deemed allocated on the same basis as Net Income and Net Loss for such respective period.
(c) Allocations Respecting Section 704(c) and Revaluations; Curative Allocations Resulting from the Ceiling Rule.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b) hereof, Tax Items with respect to Partnership property that is subject to Code Section 704(c) and/or Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) (collectively “Section 704(c) Tax Items”) shall be allocated in accordance with said Code section and/or Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(i), as the case may be.
The allocation of Tax Items shall be in accordance with the “traditional method” set forth in Treas.
Reg.
§1.704-3(b)(1), unless otherwise determined by the General Partner, and shall be subject to the ceiling rule stated in Regulation Section 1.704-3(b)(1).
The General Partner is authorized to specially allocate Tax Items (other than Section 704(c) Tax Items) to cure for the effect of the ceiling rule.
The intent of this Section 3(c) is that each Partner who contributed to the capital of the EX B-7
Partnership a partnership interest in an existing Property Partnership will bear, through reduced allocations of depreciation and increased allocations of gain or other items, the tax detriments associated with any Precontribution Gain and this Section 3(c) shall be interpreted consistently with such intent.4.
Allocations Upon Final Liquidation.With respect to the fiscal year in which the final liquidation of the Partnership occurs in accordance with Section 7.2 of the Agreement, and notwithstanding any other provision of Sections 1, 2, or 3 hereof, items of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall be specially allocated to the Preferred Units in a manner necessary to cause the Partners’ capital accounts attributable to their Preferred Units to equal the amounts that will be distributed in respect of the Preferred Units under Section 7.2.
Any such allocations shall be made first from items of income constituting Operating Income or Operating Loss, and only thereafter from items of income constituting Liquidating Gains or Liquidating Losses.

The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person (a “Covered Person”) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature (a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such Covered Person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was, at any time during which these Bylaws are in effect or any time prior thereto (whether or not such Covered Person continues to serve in such capacity at the time any indemnification or payment of expenses pursuant hereto is sought or at the time any proceeding relating thereto exists or is brought), a director or officer of the Corporation (including, for the purposes of this Article XIII, any predecessor of the Corporation absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation, merger or reorganization), or has or had agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or while a director or officer of the Corporation is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust, nonprofit entity or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered (including, without limitation, any judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements), actually and reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in connection with such proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and administrators, and the Corporation may enter into agreements with any such person for the purpose of providing for such indemnification.
For purposes of this Article XIII, a director or officer of the Corporation serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent or in any other capacity (a) at a company of which the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a 19
majority of the shares or other interests entitled to vote in the election of its directors or the members of a comparable governing body or (ii) at an employee benefit plan of the Corporation or of any such company described in clause (a) shall be deemed to have served in such capacity at the request of the Corporation.
Except as otherwise provided in this Article XIII, and other than proceedings to enforce rights conferred by the Certificate of Incorporation or this Article XIII, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XIII shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time (and subject to filing a written request for indemnification pursuant to the following paragraph of Section 1 of this Article XIII); provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer (or a former director or officer) in such person’s capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation for such expenses under this Article XIII or otherwise.
The rights conferred upon Covered Persons in this Article XIII shall be contract rights that vest at the time of such person’s service to or at the request of the Corporation and such rights shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators.To obtain advancement or indemnification under this Article XIII, a claimant shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to advancement or indemnification.
In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors unless there shall have occurred within two (2) years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a “Change of Control” (as defined below), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors.
determination.
As used herein, “Change in Control” means the happening of any of the following events: (A) any Person (as hereinafter defined) acquires Beneficial Ownership (as hereinafter defined) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock; (B) consummation of a Business Combination (as hereinafter defined), unless, following such Business Combination, (x) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities that were the Beneficial Owners of the outstanding Voting Stock immediately prior to such Business Combination Beneficially Own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the issued and outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or equivalent) of the entity resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a company that, as a result of such transaction, owns the Corporation or all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the voting power of the Voting Stock, and (y) no Person Beneficially Owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the issued and outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or equivalent) of such entity; (C) approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of a liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation; or (D) individuals who, as of November 9, 2010, constitute the Board of Directors (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors (provided, however, that any individual whose election or nomination for election by the Corporation’s shareholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors comprising the incumbent Board of Directors as of such election or nomination, shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board).
In this paragraph, the terms (I) “Beneficial Owner,” “Beneficially Own” and “Beneficial Ownership” are used as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act (but without taking into account any contractual restrictions or limitations on voting or other rights), (II) “Business Combination” means (a) any merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar business combination transaction involving the Corporation with any Person or (b) the sale or other disposition by the Corporation of all or substantially all of its assets; and (III) “Person” means an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act).SECTION 2.
It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
21
SECTION 3.
The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred on any Covered Person by this Article XIII (i) shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise and (ii) cannot be terminated by the Corporation, the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation with respect to a Covered Person’s service occurring prior to the date of such termination.
The Corporation may enter into agreements providing for indemnity of or advancement of expenses to a director or officer containing such provisions further to the provisions of this Article XIII as the Board of Directors determines is in the best interests of the Corporation.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation’s obligation to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person has collected as indemnification from such other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust, nonprofit entity, or other enterprise; and, in the event the Corporation has fully paid such expenses, the Covered Person shall return to the Corporation any amounts subsequently received from such other source of indemnification.Any repeal, other termination, amendment, alteration or modification of the provisions of this Article XIII that in any way diminishes, limits, restricts, adversely affects or eliminates any right of an indemnitee or such person’s successors to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise shall be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish, limit, restrict, adversely affect or eliminate any such right with respect to any actual or alleged act or omission occurring prior thereto while such a person was a director or officer of the Corporation or any actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission then or previously existing, or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission.SECTION 4.
This Article XIII shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and advance expenses (on substantially similar terms and subject to the same obligations as those set forth in Sections 1 through 3 of this Article XIII) to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by the Board of Directors.
In addition, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, on behalf of any person who is or was a Covered Person and any employee or agent of the Corporation or its subsidiaries against any liability, expense or loss asserted against such person and incurred by such person in such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or obligation to indemnify such person against such liability, expense or loss.SECTION 5.
If any provision or provisions of this Article XIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article XIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article XIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, 22
illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article XIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article XIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.SECTION 6.
For purposes of this Article XIII:(1) “Disinterested Director” means a director of the Corporation who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant.
(2) “Independent Counsel” means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and indemnification issues and neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Corporation or the claimant in any matter material to either such party, or (ii) any other party to the proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Independent Counsel” shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the claimant in an action to determine the claimant’s rights under this Article XIII.SECTION 7.
The stockholders of the Corporation shall have the power to amend, modify or repeal these Bylaws, or adopt any new provision authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware in force at such time, at a duly called meeting of the stockholders; provided, that notice of the proposed adoption, amendment, modification or repeal was given in the notice of the meeting.
These Bylaws may be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors recommends that stockholders approve such amendment or repeal, such amendment or repeal shall only require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class.

In the event BAM elects to acquire some or all of the Subject Class A Shares from the Exchanging Class A Shareholder in exchange for the BPY Units Amount, BAM may elect to either satisfy the amount of any tax withholding due upon the exchange of Subject Class A Shares by retaining BPY Units with a fair market value, as reasonably determined by BAM in good faith, equal to the amount of such obligation, or satisfy such tax withholding obligation using amounts paid by BAM, which amounts shall be treated as a loan by BAM to the Exchanging Class A Shareholder, in each case, unless the Exchanging Class A Shareholder, at the Exchanging Class A Shareholder’s election, has paid or has made arrangements satisfactory to BAM, in its sole discretion, to pay, the amount of any such tax withholding.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(b), in no event shall an Exchanging Class A Shareholder be subject to withholding both under subsection C(3)(d) of Article IV of the Company Charter and under this Section 6(b), and any amounts paid or withheld with respect to a Subject Class A - 11 -

For the avoidance of doubt, any Class A Shareholder who receives the Cash Amount in satisfaction of the Secondary Exchange Right with respect to any Class A Share pursuant to this Agreement shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of BPY Units at any time with respect to the BPY Units for which the Secondary Exchange Right with respect to such Subject Class A Share was exercisable prior to the receipt of such Cash Amount.Section 8.
Collateral Account.
(a) BAM or one or more Affiliates of BAM shall establish one or more non-interest bearing trust accounts in the name of BAM or such Affiliates that will be administered by the Rights Agent (together, the “Collateral Account”).
BAM shall be responsible for ensuring that the Collateral Account Balance shall at times equal or exceed the Required Collateral Account Balance.

rights and/or obligations) to convert or redeem any BPY Unit Convertibles if necessary to satisfy any Class A Shareholder’s Secondary Exchange Right in accordance with this Agreement, and any delivery of a BPY Unit Amount pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in the form of BPY Units and not, for the avoidance of doubt, in the form of BPY Unit Convertibles.

The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation to calculate the Conversion Factor, to determine the number of Class A Shares issued, or to determine the number of BPY Units or BPY Unit Convertibles necessary to equal the product of (i) the number of such Class A Shares issued (excluding any shares issued to BAM or its Affiliates) multiplied by (ii) the Conversion Factor.
(c) Except as set forth in this Section 8(c), BAM and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to withdraw any BPY Unit or BPY Unit Convertible from the Collateral Account.
