(f)          Except as otherwise provided in ARTICLE 2 and Section 4.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions would (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment): (i) entitle any employee, officer, or director to any compensation or benefit; (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the value of, or trigger any payment or funding of any compensation or benefit or trigger any other material obligations under, any Benefit Plan; or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or default under, or limit the Company’s right to amend, modify, or terminate any Benefit Plan.

(iv)        (A) any representation or warranty of the non-terminating Party is inaccurate as of the Signing Date, but only if the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) (with respect to inaccuracies in any of the Buyer Entity’s representations or warranties) or Section 7.3(a) (with respect to inaccuracies in any of the Company’s representations or warranties) would not be satisfied were such inaccuracy to continue to be in existence as of the Closing, and (B) with respect to any representation or warranty of the non-terminating Party that is accurate as of the Signing Date, such representation or warranty later becomes (as if made as of a date of determination) inaccurate, but only if the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) (with respect to inaccuracies in any of the Buyer Entity’s representations or warranties) or Section 7.3(a) (with respect to inaccuracies in any of the Company’s representations or warranties) would not be satisfied were such inaccuracy to continue to be in existence as of the Closing, and such representation or warranty (I) is incapable of being made to be accurate, (II) by its nature or timing cannot reasonably be made to be accurate by the Outside Date, or (III) if such representation or warranty can be made accurate, is not made accurate within 10 Business Days after the terminating Party provides written notice to the non-terminating Party of such inaccuracy; except that neither the Company nor the Parent will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(iv) if the Company (if the Company is the Party seeking termination) or any Buyer Entity (if the Parent is the Party seeking termination) is then in material breach of such terminating Party’s obligations hereunder or if any representation or warranty of such terminating Party hereunder is materially inaccurate;   (v)         (A) if a Party breaches any of such Party’s obligations hereunder such that, at such time, the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) (with respect to breaches of the Parent’s obligations) or Section 7.3(b) (with respect to breaches of the Company’s obligations) would not be satisfied were such breach to continue to be in existence as of the Closing and (B) either (I) such breach is not cured within ten Business Days after the breaching Party receives written notice thereof from the terminating Party or (II) such breach, by its nature, cannot be cured before the Outside Date; except that: (1)         clause (B) of this Section 8.1(b)(v) will not apply with respect to any breach by the Company of any of the Company’s obligations under Section 6.1(b)(iii) or 6.12(b) that entitles (whether with or without notice, the passage of time, or both) any Person that is a Company Series B Preferred Stock Holder (whether in such Person’s capacity as such a Holder or in such Person’s capacity as a Warrant Holder) to a right (including the right to require the Company to redeem shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock) that results in, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Liability of the Company (including any cash payment by the Company) in an amount exceeding $100,000 (in the aggregate when considered with other such breaches of Section 6.1(b)(iii) or 6.12(b)), except to the extent that (x) such right has been waived (but only for so long as such right has been waived) or (y) such breach has been cured such that no such Person has such right (it being understood that nothing in this clause (1) will constitute a waiver of any rights of any Company Series B Preferred Stock Holder (except to the extent that any such rights have been waived under the Waiver Agreement to which such Company Series B Preferred Stock Holder is a party)); and (2)         neither the Company nor the Parent will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(v) if the Company (if the Company is the Party seeking termination) or any Buyer Entity (if the Parent is the Party seeking termination) is then in material breach of such terminating Party’s obligations hereunder or if any representation or warranty of such terminating Party hereunder is materially inaccurate; (c)          by Parent, upon written notice to the Company if:
 (i)          prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change occurs or (B) the Company Board fails to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within four Business Days after the Company receives a written request therefor from the Parent at any time after an Acquisition Proposal has been made publicly and not publicly rejected by the Company Board;  (ii)         the Company breaches any of the Company’s obligations under Section 6.2; (iii)        the Company Board makes an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.2 because of a Superior Proposal; (iv)        any Company Entity: (A) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a custodian, receiver, or trustee for its or a substantial part of such Company Entity’s assets; (B) voluntarily commences any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws; (C) has any petition filed, or any proceeding commenced against it, in which an adjudication is made or order for relief is entered or that remains undismissed for a period of 30 days; (D) has a receiver, custodian, or trustee appointed for all or a substantial part of such Company Entity’s property; or (E) takes any action effectuating, approving, or consenting to any of the events described in the immediately foregoing clauses (A) through (D); except that the Parent will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(iv) if the Parent is then in material breach of its obligations hereunder; or (v)         any Waiver Agreement is not in full force and effect or there is an uncured breach or default by the Company under any Waiver Agreement.

In order for the Company or the Parent, as the case might be, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the terminating Party must provide written Notice of such termination to the non-terminating Party specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected, and such termination will be effective (subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE 8) at the time when such terminating Party has provided such Notice to the non-terminating Party.

one of the Events (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.d) of the Registration Rights Agreement shall not have been cured to the satisfaction of the Holders prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days from the Event Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) relating thereto; v.          the Corporation shall fail for any reason to pay in full the amount of cash due pursuant to a Buy-In (provided that such cash due shall exceed $25,000 in the aggregate) within five calendar days after notice therefor is delivered hereunder (unless such amount is being contested in good faith);  vi.
unless specifically addressed elsewhere in these Series A Preference Terms as a Triggering Event, the Corporation shall knowingly and willfully fail to observe or perform in any material respect any other material covenant or agreement contained in the Series A Preference Terms or the Waiver Agreement, and such failure shall not, if subject to the possibility of a cure by the Corporation, have been cured within 30 calendar days after the date on which the Holder notifies the Corporation in writing of such failure; viii.
there shall have occurred a Bankruptcy Event; or ix.

Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company.
