(h)            The right of the Company Shareholders to receive the Earnout Shares shall not entitle the holder thereof to any voting or dividend rights otherwise granted to holders of Company Ordinary Shares (if any) prior to the issuance of such shares.

9   (ix)          Transfers of any Company Ordinary Shares acquired as part of the PIPE Financing; (x)           transactions relating to Company Ordinary Shares or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Company Ordinary Shares acquired in open market transactions after the Closing, provided that no such transaction is required to be, or is, publicly announced (whether on Form 4, Form 5 or otherwise, other than a required filing on Schedule 13F, 13G or 13G/A) during the applicable Lock-Up Period; (xi)           the exercise of any options or warrants to purchase Company Ordinary Shares (which exercises may be effected on a cashless basis to the extent the instruments representing such options or warrants permit exercises on a cashless basis); (xii)         Transfers to the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans or arrangements; (xiii)        Transfers to the Company pursuant to any contractual arrangement in effect at the Closing that provides for the repurchase by the Company or forfeiture of Sponsor’s Company Ordinary Shares or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Company Ordinary Shares in connection with the termination of Sponsor’s service to the Company; (xiv)        the establishment of a trading plan that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (a “Trading Plan”); provided, however, that no sales of Locked-Up Shares, shall be made by Sponsor pursuant to such Trading Plan during the applicable Lock-Up Period and no public announcement or filing is voluntarily made regarding such plan during the applicable Lock-Up Period; (xv)         Transfers made after the date on which the closing price of the Company Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $17.50 per share for any twenty (20) Trading Days within any consecutive thirty (30) Trading Day period after the Closing Date; (xvi)        Transfers made in connection with a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange their Company Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property subsequent to the Closing Date; and (xvii)       transactions to satisfy any U.S. federal, state, or local income tax obligations of Sponsor (or its direct or indirect owners) arising from a change in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a change in or promulgation of new U.S. Treasury Regulations, or promulgation of any judicial or administrative guidance, in each case, after the date on which the Merger Agreement was executed by the parties, and such change or promulgation prevents the Mergers from qualifying as a “reorganization” pursuant to Section 368 of the Code, in each case, solely to the extent necessary to cover any tax liability as a result of the transaction.
10   provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i) through (viii), these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement, in substantially the form of this Agreement, agreeing to be bound by the Lock-Up Restrictions and shall have the same rights and benefits under this Agreement.
For purposes of this paragraph, “immediate family” shall mean a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild or other lineal descendant (including by adoption), father, mother, brother or sister of an individual; and “affiliate” shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
(c)            For the avoidance of doubt, Sponsor shall retain all of its rights as a shareholder of the Company during the Lock-Up Period, including the right to vote any Locked-Up Shares or receive any dividends or distributions thereon.
(d)            In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company, and any duly appointed transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the Locked-Up Shares, are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if such Transfer would constitute a violation or breach of the Lock-Up Restrictions.
4.14          Earn-In Provisions.
(a)            Each of the Company and Sponsor agrees that (x), immediately after the First Effective Time, 6,393,750 of the Company Ordinary Shares held by Sponsor immediately after the First Effective Time shall become unvested shares (the “Earn-In Shares”) and shall be subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in this Section 4.14 and (y) each Earn-In Share shall not be transferable until such Earn-In Share vests pursuant to this Section 4.14 and until such Earn-In Share vests, any certificate representing such Earn-In Share shall bear a legend referencing that such Earn-In Share is subject to forfeiture pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, and the Company shall be authorized to instruct its transfer agent to implement appropriate stop transfer orders that will be applicable until such Earn-In Share vests; provided that the foregoing transfer restriction under Section 4.14(a)(y) shall not apply to Transfers to any shareholder, partner or member of Sponsor or their affiliates or, in the case of an individual who is such a shareholder, partner or member (or affiliate thereof), further Transfers by such shareholder, partner or member (or affiliate thereof) by gift to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of the individual’s immediate family, so long as (1) such Transfer is in compliance with any applicable securities laws and (2) any transferee thereof enters into a written agreement, in substantially the form of this Agreement, agrees to be bound by the vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in this Section 4.14 and to receive the rights of a holder of the Earn-In Shares hereunder).
For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by Sponsor other than the Earn-In Shares, shall not be subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in this Section 4.14.
11
Any forfeiture of Company Ordinary Shares, and all references to forfeiture of Company Ordinary Shares, described in this Agreement shall take effect as a surrender of Company Ordinary Shares for no consideration as a matter of Cayman Islands law.
(e)            Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, prior to the date that an Earn-In Share is no longer subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in this Section 4.14, Sponsor will remain entitled to all of the other rights of a holder of Company Ordinary Shares, including to (i) exercise voting rights carried by such Earn-In Share and (ii) receive any dividends or other distributions in respect of such Earn-In Share.
12   (f)            Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 4.14 to the contrary, if any of the terms of the Merger Agreement in respect of the Earnout Shares are less restrictive than those agreed to herein (or such terms and conditions are subsequently relaxed including as a result of a modification, waiver or amendment), then the less restrictive terms and conditions shall apply to the Earn-In Shares.
For the avoidance of doubt, if any Earnout Shares are issued by the Company to the Earnout Participants prior to the occurrence of any Earnout Event or Acceleration Event, the corresponding number (based upon the corresponding trigger price) of the Earn-In Shares shall vest and the remaining number of the Earn-In Shares subject to this Section 4.14 shall be adjusted accordingly.
(g)            The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that the Earn-In Shares are intended to constitute “voting stock” within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder received by Sponsor in connection with the Mergers, and shall file all Tax Returns consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) such treatment.
ARTICLE V
General Provisions 5.1            If, during the period between Closing and prior to the expiration of the Earnout Period, the Company shall pay an dividend on Company Ordinary Shares by the issuance of additional Company Ordinary Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the issued and outstanding Company Ordinary Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of Company Ordinary Shares, then in each such case, (i) the number of Earn-In Shares shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Company Ordinary Shares (including any other shares so reclassified as Company Ordinary Shares) issued and outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of Company Ordinary Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to such event and (ii) the dollar values set forth in each of Section 4.13(b)(xv), Section 4.14(c) and Section 4.14(d) shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to Sponsor the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.
Any holder of a Locked-Up Share and/or Earn-In Share is an express third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.2 and entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.2 directly against the Company.

2.1.1 Filing.
Such Shelf shall provide for the resale of the Registrable Securities included therein pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, any Holder named therein.
The Company shall maintain a Shelf in accordance with the terms hereof, and shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and supplements as may be necessary to keep a Shelf continuously effective, available for use and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities.
In the event the Company files a Form F-1 Shelf, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Form F-1 Shelf (and any Subsequent Shelf Registration) to a Form F-3 Shelf as soon as practicable after the Company is eligible to use Form F-3.
2.1.2 Subsequent Shelf Registration.
If any Shelf ceases to be effective under the Securities Act for any reason at any time while Registrable Securities are still outstanding, the Company shall, subject to Section 3.4, use its commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable cause such Shelf to again become effective under the Securities Act (including obtaining the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf), and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable amend such Shelf in a manner reasonably expected to result in the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf or file an additional registration statement as a Shelf Registration (a “Subsequent Shelf Registration”) registering the resale of all Registrable Securities (determined as of two business days prior to such filing), and pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, any Holder named therein.
If a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the filing thereof (it being agreed that the Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be an automatic shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) if the Company is a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) at the most recent applicable eligibility determination date), and (ii) keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously effective, available for use and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities.
Any such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on Form F-3 or Form S-3, as applicable, to the extent that the Company is eligible to use such form.
Otherwise, such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on another appropriate form.
   2.1.3 Additional Registerable Securities.
Subject to Section 3.4, in the event that any Holder holds Registrable Securities that are not registered for resale on a delayed or continuous basis, the Company, upon written request of the Holder, shall promptly use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the resale of such Registrable Securities to be covered by either, at the Company’s option, any then available Shelf (including by means of a post-effective amendment) or by filing a Subsequent Shelf Registration and cause the same to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and such Shelf or Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be subject to the terms hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall only be required to cause such Registrable Securities to be covered twice per calendar year for any Holder.
Subject to Section 2.4.4, the Demanding Holder shall have the right to select the Underwriters for such offering (which shall consist of one or more reputable nationally recognized investment banks), subject to the Company’s prior approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Such Demanding Holders shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Shelf Takedown.
2.1.5 Reduction of Underwritten Offering.
If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holder and the Holders requesting piggy back rights pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Underwritten Shelf Takedown (the “Requesting Holders”) (if any) in writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holder and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell and all other Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities, if any, that have been requested to be sold in such Underwritten Offering pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by any other shareholders, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as applicable, the “Maximum Number of Securities”), then the Company shall include in such Underwritten Offering, before including any Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities proposed to be sold by Company or by other holders of Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities, the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holder and the Requesting Holders (if any) (pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that such Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holder and Requesting Holders have requested be included in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with an Underwritten Shelf Takedown prior to its withdrawal under this Section 2.1.6.
   2.1.7 New Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this Section 2.1, in the event the Commission informs the Company that the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the Holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the Shelf Registration as required by the Commission and/or (ii) withdraw the Shelf Registration and file a new registration statement (a “New Registration Statement”), on Form F-3 or if Form F-3 is not then available to the Company for such registration statement, on such other form available to register for resale of the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering; provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration Statement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-available written or oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the Commission staff (“SEC Guidance”), including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations D.29.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation on the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the Company advocated with the Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain Holders must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such Holders.
In the event the Company amends the Shelf Registration or files a New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company will file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more registration statements on Form F-3 or such other form available to register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the Shelf Registration, as amended, or the New Registration Statement.
2.1.8 Effective Registration.
2.2 Piggyback Registration.
2.2.1 Piggyback Rights.
Subject to Section 2.4.3, if the Company or any Holder proposes to conduct a registered offering of, or if the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Registration of, equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the account of shareholders of the Company (or by the Company and by the shareholders of the Company including, without limitation, an Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof), other than a Registration Statement (or any registered offering with respect thereto) (i) filed in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form F-4 or Form S-4 (or other similar form that relates to a transaction subject to Rule 145 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the Company, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, or (v) for a rights offering, then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed offering to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but not less than ten (10) days before the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Shelf Registration, the applicable “red herring” prospectus or prospectus supplement used for marketing such offering, which notice shall (A) describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to include in such registered offering such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in writing within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice (such registered offering, a “Piggyback Registration”).
Subject to Section 2.2.2, the Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback Registration and, if applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of such Piggyback Registration to permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this Section 2.2.1 to be included therein on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in such registered offering and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
The inclusion of any Holder’s Registrable Securities in a Piggyback Registration shall be subject to such Holder’s agreement to enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the Company.
   2.2.2 Reduction of Piggyback Registration.
If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering that is to be a Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing that the dollar amount or number of the Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, taken together with (i) the Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities, if any, as to which Registration or a registered offering has been demanded pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which registration has been requested pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, and (iii) the Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities, if any, as to which Registration or a registered offering has been requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other shareholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then: (a) if the Registration or registered offering is undertaken for the Company’s account, the Company shall include in any such Registration or registered offering (A) first, the Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.2.1, pro rata, based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering and the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities, if any, as to which Registration or a registered offering has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights of persons or entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder; (b) if the Registration or registered offering is pursuant to a request by persons or entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall include in any such Registration or registered offering (A) first, the Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.2.1, pro rata, based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering and the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the shares of Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the shares of Company Ordinary Shares or other equity securities for the account of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (c) if the Registration or registered offering is pursuant to a request by Holder(s) of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, then the Company shall include in any such Registration or registered offering securities in the priority set forth in Section 2.1.5.
Any Holder of Registrable Securities (other than the Demanding Holder, whose right to withdrawal from an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, and related obligations, shall be governed by Section 2.1.6) shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such Piggyback Registration or, in the case of a Piggyback Registration pursuant to a Shelf Registration, the filing of the applicable “red herring” prospectus or prospectus supplement with respect to such Piggyback Registration used for marketing such transaction.
The Company (whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a Piggyback Registration (which, in no circumstance, shall include the Shelf) at any time prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than Section 2.1.6), the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal under this Section 2.2.3.

   3.1.16 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection with such Registration; and 3.1.17 upon request of a Holder, the Company shall (i) authorize the Company’s transfer agent to remove any legend on share certificates of such Holder’s Company Ordinary Shares restricting further transfer (or any similar restriction in book entry positions of such Holder) if such restrictions are no longer required by the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws or any agreement with the Company to which such Holder is a party, including if such shares subject to such a restriction have been sold on a Registration Statement, (ii) request the Company’s transfer agent to issue in lieu thereof Company Ordinary Shares without such restrictions to the Holder upon, as applicable, surrender of any stock certificates evidencing such shares of Company Ordinary Shares, or to update the applicable book entry position of such Holder so that it no longer is subject to such a restriction, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Holder to have such Holder’s Company Ordinary Shares transferred into a book-entry position at The Depository Trust Company, in each case, subject to delivery of customary documentation, including any documentation required by such restrictive legend or book-entry notation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any documents or information to an Underwriter or other sales agent or placement agent if such Underwriter or other sales agent or placement agent has not then been named with respect to the applicable Underwritten Offering or Other Coordinated Offering that is registered pursuant to a Registration Statement.
3.2 Registration Expenses.
All Registration Expenses shall be borne by the Company.
It is acknowledged by the Holders that the Holders selling any Registrable Securities in an offering shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters’ or agents’ commissions and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set forth in the definition of “Registration Expenses,” all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders, in each case pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities that such Holders have sold in such Registration.
3.3 Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Holder does not provide the Company with its requested Holder Information, the Company may exclude such Holder’s Registrable Securities from the applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus if the Company determines, based on the advice of counsel, that such information is necessary to effect the registration and such Holder continues thereafter to withhold such information.
No person may participate in any Underwritten Offering or Other Coordinated Offering for equity securities of the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person’s securities on the basis provided in any arrangements approved by the Company and (ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting or other agreements and other customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such arrangements.
The exclusion of a Holder’s Registrable Securities as a result of this Section 3.3 shall not affect the registration of the other Registrable Securities to be included in such Registration.
3.4 Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure; Restrictions on Registration Rights.
3.4.2 If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would (a) require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, (b) require the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Company’s control, or (c) in the good faith judgment of the majority of the Board, be materially detrimental to the Company and the majority of the Board concludes as a result that it is essential to defer such filing, initial effectiveness or continued use at such time, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose (any such period, a “Blackout Period”); provided, that no Blackout Period shall exceed more than 60 consecutive days after the request of the Holders is given.
In the event the Company exercises its rights under this Section 3.4.2, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities.
3.4.3 (a) During the period starting with the date 60 days prior to the Company’s good faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date 120 days after the effective date of, a Company-initiated Registration and provided that the Company continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the applicable Shelf, or (b) if, pursuant to Section 2.1.4, Holders have requested an Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the Company and such Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly underwrite such offering, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay any other registered offering pursuant to Sections 2.1.4 or 2.4.
3.4.4 The right to delay or suspend any filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 3.4.2 or a registered offering pursuant to Section 3.4.3 shall be exercised by the Company, in the aggregate, for not more than 60 consecutive calendar days and not more than twice during any 12-month period.
3.5 Reporting Obligations.
The Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of Company Ordinary Shares held by such Holder without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule then in effect).
ARTICLE IV
INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION 4.1 Indemnification.
4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers, directors and agents and each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses (including without limitation reasonable outside attorneys’ fees) resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein or any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction of the Company in connection therewith.
4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (the “Holder Information”) and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors, officers and agents and each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses (including without limitation reasonable outside attorneys’ fees) resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.
   4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any person’s right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.
4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.
The Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the Company’s or such Holder’s indemnification is unavailable for any reason.
4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under Section 4.1 hereof from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party’s and indemnified party’s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action; provided, however, that the liability of any Holder under this Section 4.1.5 shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 4.1.1, 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 above, any legal or other fees, charges or out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.1.5 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 4.1.5.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this Section 4.1.5 from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Registration of Subscribed Shares.
a.
Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Subscriber, the Subscriber shall not be identified as a statutory underwriter in the Registration Statement unless requested by the Commission or another regulatory agency; provided, that if the Commission or another regulatory agency requests that Subscriber be identified as a statutory underwriter in the Registration Statement, Subscriber will have the opportunity to withdraw from the Registration Statement upon its prompt written request to the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Commission prevents the Company from including any or all of the shares proposed to be registered under the Registration Statement due to limitations on the use of Rule 415 under the Securities Act for the resale of the Subscribed Shares by the applicable shareholders or otherwise, such Registration Statement shall register for resale such number of Subscribed Shares which is equal to the maximum number of Subscribed Shares as is permitted to be registered by the Commission.
In such event, the number of Subscribed Shares to be registered for each selling shareholder named in the Registration Statement shall be reduced pro rata among all such selling shareholders.
The undersigned agrees to disclose its beneficial ownership, as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of Subscribed Shares to the Company upon request to assist the Company in making the determination described above.
The Company’s obligations to include the Subscribed Shares in the Registration Statement are contingent upon Subscriber furnishing in writing to the Company such information regarding Subscriber, the securities of the Company held by Subscriber and the intended method of disposition of the Subscribed Shares as shall be reasonably requested by the Company to effect the registration of the Subscribed Shares, and Subscriber shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request that are customary for a selling shareholder in similar situations, including providing that the Company shall be entitled to postpone and suspend the use of the Registration Statement in connection with a Suspension Event (as defined below) as permitted hereunder, provided that Subscriber shall not in connection with the foregoing be required to execute any lock-up or similar agreement or otherwise be subject to any contractual restriction on the ability to transfer the Subscribed Shares.
In the case of the registration effected by the Company pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, the Company shall, upon reasonable request, inform Subscriber as to the status of such registration.
Unless otherwise consented to by the Company, Subscriber shall not be entitled to use the Registration Statement for an underwritten offering of Subscribed Shares.
For purposes of this Section 6, “Subscribed Shares” shall include the Subscribed Shares acquired pursuant to this Subscription Agreement and any other equity security of the Company issued or issuable with respect to the Subscribed Shares by way of share split, dividend, distribution, recapitalization, merger, exchange, replacement or similar event or otherwise, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any other equity security of the Company owned or acquired by Subscriber.
For purposes of clarification, any failure by the Company to file the Registration Statement by the Filing Deadline shall not otherwise relieve the Company of its obligations to file or effect the Registration Statement set forth in this Section 6.
-18-  b.
The Company agrees that, except for such times as the Company is permitted hereunder to suspend the use of the prospectus forming part of a Registration Statement, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to remain effective with respect to Subscriber until the earliest of (i) the fourth anniversary of the Closing, (ii) the date on which the Subscriber ceases to hold any Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, or (iii) on the date on which the Subscriber is able to sell all of its Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement (or shares received in exchange therefor) under Rule 144 of the Securities Act within ninety (90) days without limitation as to the amount of such securities that may be sold and without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable).
The Subscriber agrees to disclose its ownership and any other information reasonably requested to the Company upon request to assist it in making the determination described above.
At its expense, the Company shall:  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall not, in its notification advising Subscriber of such events, provide Subscriber with any material, nonpublic information regarding the Company other than to the extent that providing notice to Subscriber of the occurrence of the events listed in (A) through (C) above may be deemed to constitute material, nonpublic information regarding the Company;
-19-
-20-
 c.             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may delay or postpone filing of such Registration Statement and from time to time require Subscriber not to sell under the Registration Statement or suspend the use of any such Registration Statement if it reasonably determines, upon advice of legal counsel, that in order for the Registration Statement to not contain a material misstatement or omission, an amendment thereto would be needed, or if the negotiation or consummation of a transaction by the Company or its subsidiaries is pending or an event has occurred, which negotiation, consummation or event, the Company’s board of directors reasonably believes, upon the advice of legal counsel, would require additional disclosure by the Company in the Registration Statement of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and the non-disclosure of which in the Registration Statement would be expected, in the reasonable determination of the Company’s board of directors, upon the advice of legal counsel, to cause the Registration Statement to fail to comply with applicable disclosure requirements (each such circumstance, a “Suspension Event”); provided, that, (i) the Company shall not so delay filing or so suspend the use of the Registration Statement for a period of more than sixty (60) consecutive days, or for more than a total of one hundred twenty (120) days, or on more than two (2) occasions, in each case in any three hundred sixty (360)-day period and (ii) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such registration statement available for the sale by Subscriber of such securities as soon as practicable thereafter.
d.            Subscriber hereby agrees that neither it, nor any person or entity acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with it, shall execute any short sales or engage in other similar or equivalent hedging transactions of any kind (including, without limitation, any purchase or sale of, or entry into, any put or call option, or combination thereof, forward, swap or any other derivative transaction or similar instrument, including without limitation equity repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements, however, described or defined) designed or intended, or which could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, a sale, loan, pledge or other disposition or transfer (whether by the Subscriber or any other person) of any economic consequences of ownership, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, physically or synthetically, of any Subscribed Shares, any securities of the SPAC or any instrument exchangeable for or convertible into any securities of the Company prior to the closing of the Transaction, whether any such transaction or arrangement (or instrument provided for thereunder) would be settled by delivery of securities of the SPAC or the Company, in cash or otherwise, or to publicly disclose the intention to undertake any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Subscriber that is a multi-managed investment vehicle or an owner of a separate account whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Subscriber’s assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of such Subscriber’s assets, the restriction set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Subscribed Shares covered by this Subscription Agreement.
-21-  e.             The parties agree that:
-22-
-23-   f.              Subscriber may request that the Company remove any restrictive legend from the book-entry position evidencing the Subscribed Shares.
Within three (3) Business Days of such request, subject to the Company and its transfer agent’s receipt from Subscriber of customary representations and other documentation reasonably acceptable to them in connection therewith, and, if required by the transfer agent, an opinion of Company’s counsel reasonably acceptable to the transfer agent to the effect that the removal of restrictive legends in such circumstances may be effected under the Securities Act.
If restrictive legends are no longer required for the Subscribed Shares under the Securities Act, Subscriber may request that the restrictive legends be removed from the Subscribed Shares.
-24-  g.             All expenses incurred in connection with registration of the Subscribed Shares pursuant to this Section 6 shall be borne by the Company.

Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the SPAC to pay its tax obligations and to fund certain of its working capital requirements, the cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only for the purposes set forth in the Prospectus.
For and in consideration of the SPAC entering into this Subscription Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Subscriber hereby irrevocably waives any and all right, title and interest, or any claim of any kind it has or may have in the future, in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8 shall be deemed to limit Subscriber’s right, title, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account by virtue of its record or beneficial ownership of any Common Stock currently outstanding on the date hereof, pursuant to a validly exercised redemption right with respect to any such Common Stock, except to the extent that Subscriber has otherwise agreed with the SPAC to not exercise such redemption right.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1.
Assignment and Assumption; Amendment; Appointment of Warrant Agent.
1.1         Assignment and Assumption.
SPAC hereby assigns to the Company all of SPAC’s right, title and interest in and to the Existing Warrant Agreement and the Warrants (each as amended hereby) as of the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
The Company hereby assumes, and agrees to pay, perform, satisfy and discharge in full, as the same become due, all of SPAC’s liabilities and obligations under the Existing Warrant Agreement and the Warrants (each as amended hereby) arising from and after the Closing.

2.
Warrants.
2.1         Form of Warrant.
Each Warrant shall initially be issued in registered form only.
2.2         Effect of Countersignature.
If a physical certificate is issued, unless and until countersigned by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a certificated Warrant shall be invalid and of no effect and may not be exercised by the holder thereof.
2.3         Registration.
2.3.1      Warrant Register.
The Warrant Agent shall maintain books (the “Warrant Register”), for the registration of original issuance and the registration of transfer of the Warrants.
Ownership of beneficial interests in the Public Warrants shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by institutions that have accounts with The Depository Trust Company (the “Depositary”) (such institution, with respect to a Warrant in its account, a “Participant”).
If the Depositary subsequently ceases to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Public Warrants, the Company may instruct the Warrant Agent regarding making other arrangements for book-entry settlement.
In the event the person whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any Warrant shall have ceased to serve in the capacity in which such person signed the Warrant before such Warrant is issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he or she had not ceased to be such at the date of issuance.
2.3.2       Registered Holder.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Warrant, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name such Warrant is registered in the Warrant Register (the “Registered Holder”) as the absolute owner of such Warrant and of each Warrant represented thereby, for the purpose of any exercise thereof, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
3  2.4         Fractional Warrants.
The Company shall not issue fractional Warrants.
If a holder of Warrants would be entitled to receive a fractional Warrant, the Company shall round down to the nearest whole number the number of Warrants to be issued to such holder.
2.5         Private Placement Warrants.
4  (g)            in the event of the Company’s completion of a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the public shareholders having the right to exchange their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property subsequent to the Effective Date; provided, however, that, in the case of clauses (a) through (f), these permitted transferees (the “Permitted Transferees”) must enter into a written agreement with the Company agreeing to be bound by the transfer restrictions in this Agreement.
3.
Terms and Exercise of Warrants.
The term “Warrant Price” as used in this Agreement shall mean the price per share (including in cash or by payment of Warrants pursuant to a “cashless exercise,” to the extent permitted hereunder) described in the prior sentence at which Ordinary Shares may be purchased at the time a Warrant is exercised.
“Business Day” means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, on which banks in New York City are generally open for normal business.
3.2         Duration of Warrants.
5  3.3         Exercise of Warrants.
3.3.1      Payment.
6  (d)            as provided in Section 6.2 hereof with respect to a Make-Whole Exercise; or (e)            as provided in Section 7.4 hereof.
3.3.2       Issuance of Ordinary Shares on Exercise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of a Warrant and shall have no obligation to settle such Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Ordinary Shares underlying the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company’s satisfying its obligations under Section 7.4 or a valid exemption from registration is available.
No Warrant shall be exercisable and the Company shall not be obligated to issue Ordinary Shares upon exercise of a Warrant unless the Ordinary Shares issuable upon such Warrant exercise have been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt from registration or qualification under the securities laws of the state of residence of the Registered Holder of the Warrants.
Subject to Section 4.6 of this Agreement, a Registered Holder of Warrants may exercise its Warrants only for a whole number of Ordinary Shares.
The Company may require holders of Public Warrants to settle the Warrant on a “cashless basis” pursuant to Section 7.4.
If, by reason of any exercise of Warrants on a “cashless basis”, the holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in an Ordinary Share, the Company shall round down to the nearest whole number, the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued to such holder.
All Ordinary Shares issued upon the proper exercise of a Warrant in conformity with this Agreement and the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as amended from time to time shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
Each person in whose name any book-entry position or certificate, as applicable, for Ordinary Shares is issued and who is registered in the register of members of the Company shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such Ordinary Shares on the date on which the Warrant, or book-entry position representing such Warrant, was surrendered and payment of the Warrant Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate in the case of a certificated Warrant, except that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date when the register of members of the Company or book-entry system of the Warrant Agent are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the share transfer books or book-entry system are open.
If the election is made by a holder, the Warrant Agent shall not effect the exercise of the holder’s Warrant, and such holder shall not have the right to exercise such Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the Warrant Agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) (the “Maximum Percentage”) of the Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates shall include the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude Ordinary Shares that would be issuable upon (x) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of the Warrant beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates and (y) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates (including, without limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred shares or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
For purposes of the Warrant, in determining the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares, the holder may rely on the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares as reflected in (1) the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F, Current Report on Form 6-K or other public filing with the Commission as the case may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (3) any other notice by the Company or Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as transfer agent (in such capacity, the “Transfer Agent”), setting forth the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding.
In any case, the number of issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of equity securities of the Company by the holder and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares was reported.
8  4.
Adjustments.
4.1         Share Capitalizations.
4.1.1      Sub-Divisions.
If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.6 below, the number of issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares is increased by a capitalization or share dividend of Ordinary Shares, or by a sub-division of Ordinary Shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such share capitalization, sub-division or similar event, the number of Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.
For purposes of this subsection 4.1.1, (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Ordinary Shares, in determining the price payable for Ordinary Shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) “Historical Fair Market Value” means the volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the Ordinary Shares trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.
No Ordinary Shares shall be issued at less than their par value.
4.2         Aggregation of Shares.
If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.6 hereof, the number of issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares is decreased by a consolidation, reverse share subdivision or reclassification of Ordinary Shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, reverse share subdivision, reclassification or similar event, the number of Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.
9  4.3         Adjustments in Exercise Price.
Whenever the number of Ordinary Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as provided in subsection 4.1.1 or Section 4.2 above, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) by multiplying such Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of Ordinary Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of Ordinary Shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.
4.5         Replacement of Securities upon Reorganization, etc.
In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares (other than a change under Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 hereof or that solely affects the par value of such Ordinary Shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which the Company is dissolved, the holders of the Warrants shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Warrants and in lieu of the Ordinary Shares of the Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares or stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the Warrants would have received if such holder had exercised his, her or its Warrant(s) immediately prior to such event (the “Alternative Issuance”); provided, however, that (i) if the holders of the Ordinary Shares were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets constituting the Alternative Issuance for which each Warrant shall become exercisable shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by the holders of the Ordinary Shares in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and (ii) if a tender, exchange or redemption offer shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of the Ordinary Shares under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares, the holder of a Warrant shall be entitled to receive as the Alternative Issuance, the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such Warrant holder had exercised the Warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Ordinary Shares held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustments (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4; provided further that if less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of the Ordinary Shares in the applicable event is payable in the form of shares in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the Registered Holder properly exercises the Warrant within thirty (30) days following the public disclosure of the consummation of such applicable event by the Company pursuant to a Current Report on Form 6-K filed with the Commission, the Warrant Price shall be reduced by an amount (in dollars) equal to the difference of (i) the Warrant Price in effect prior to such reduction minus (ii) (A) the Per Share Consideration (as defined below) (but in no event less than zero) minus (B) the Black-Scholes Warrant Value (as defined below).
The “Black-Scholes Warrant Value” means the value of a Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of the applicable event based on the Black-Scholes Warrant Model for a Capped American Call on Bloomberg Financial Markets (assuming zero dividends) (“Bloomberg”).
“Per Share Consideration” means (i) if the consideration paid to holders of the Ordinary Shares consists exclusively of cash, the amount of such cash per Ordinary Share, and (ii) in all other cases, the volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the effective date of the applicable event.
If any reclassification or reorganization also results in a change in Ordinary Shares covered by subsection 4.1.1, then such adjustment shall be made pursuant to subsection 4.1.1 or Sections 4.2, 4.3 and this Section 4.5.
The provisions of this Section 4.5 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations, mergers or consolidations, sales or other transfers.
10  4.6         Notices of Changes in Warrant.
Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such event.
Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional shares upon the exercise of Warrants.
If, by reason of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4, the holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company shall, upon such exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued to such holder.
4.8         Form of Warrant.
The form of Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4, and Warrants issued after such adjustment may state the same Warrant Price and the same number of Ordinary Shares as is stated in the Warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant that the Company may deem appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any Warrant thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.
5.
5.1         Registration of Transfer.
5.3         Fractional Warrants.
The Warrant Agent shall not be required to effect any registration of transfer or exchange which shall result in the issuance of a warrant certificate or book-entry position for a fraction of a Warrant.
5.4         Service Charges.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Warrants.
12  5.5        Warrant Execution and Countersignature.
The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign and to deliver, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Warrants required to be issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5, and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant Agent, shall supply the Warrant Agent with Warrants duly executed on behalf of the Company for such purpose.
6.
Redemption.
6.1         Redemption of Warrants for Cash.
6.2         Redemption of Warrants for Ordinary Shares.
13   The exact Redemption Fair Market Value and Redemption Date may not be set forth in the table above, in which case, if the Redemption Fair Market Value is between two values in the table or the Redemption Date is between two redemption dates in the table, the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued for each Warrant exercised in a Make-Whole Exercise shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of shares set forth for the higher and lower Redemption Fair Market Values and the earlier and later redemption dates, as applicable, based on a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable.
The share prices set forth in the column headings of the table above shall be adjusted as of any date on which the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant or the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to Section 4 hereof.
If the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant is adjusted pursuant to Section 4 hereof, the adjusted share prices in the column headings shall equal the share prices immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a Warrant as so adjusted.
The number of shares in the table above shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant.
If the Exercise Price of a Warrant is adjusted pursuant to Section 4.1.2 hereof, the adjusted share prices in the column headings shall equal the share prices immediately prior to such adjustment less the decrease in the Exercise Price pursuant to such Exercise Price adjustment.
Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the Registered Holder received such notice.
The Warrants may be exercised, for cash (or on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 6.2 of this Agreement) at any time after notice of redemption shall have been given by the Company pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof and prior to the Redemption Date.
On and after the Redemption Date, the record holder of the Warrants shall have no further rights except to receive, upon surrender of the Warrants, the Redemption Price.
6.5         Exclusion of Private Placement Warrants.
The Company agrees that (a) the redemption rights provided in Section 6.1 hereof shall not apply to the Private Placement Warrants if at the time of the redemption such Private Placement Warrants continue to be held by the Sponsor or its Permitted Transferees and (b) if the Reference Value equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (subject to adjustment in compliance with Section 4 hereof), the redemption rights provided in Section 6.2 hereof shall not apply to the Private Placement Warrants if at the time of the redemption such Private Placement Warrants continue to be held by the Sponsor or its Permitted Transferees.
However, once such Private Placement Warrants are transferred (other than to Permitted Transferees in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof), the Company may redeem the Private Placement Warrants pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2 hereof, provided that the criteria for redemption are met, including the opportunity of the holder of such Private Placement Warrants to exercise the Private Placement Warrants prior to redemption pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof.
Private Placement Warrants that are transferred to persons other than Permitted Transferees shall upon such transfer cease to be Private Placement Warrants and shall become Public Warrants under this Agreement, including for purposes of Section 9.8 hereof.
7.
Other Provisions Relating to Rights of Holders of Warrants.
7.1         No Rights as Shareholder.
A Warrant does not entitle the Registered Holder thereof to any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to receive dividends, or other distributions, to exercise any preemptive rights to vote or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of the meetings of shareholders or the election of directors of the Company or any other matter.
7.2         Lost, Stolen, Mutilated, or Destroyed Warrants.
If any Warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Company and the Warrant Agent may on such terms as to indemnity or otherwise as they may in their discretion impose (which shall, in the case of a mutilated Warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new Warrant of like denomination, tenor, and date as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed.
Any such new Warrant shall constitute a substitute contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Warrant shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.
15   7.3            Reservation of Ordinary Shares.
The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available a number of its authorized but unissued Ordinary Shares that shall be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement.
7.4            Registration of Ordinary Shares; Cashless Exercise at Company’s Option.
7.4.1            Registration of the Ordinary Shares.
The Company agrees that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days after the Effective Date, it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within sixty (60) Business Days following the Effective Date and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration or redemption of the Warrants in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
If any such registration statement has not been declared effective by the sixtieth (60th) Business Day following the Effective Date, holders of the Warrants shall have the right, during the period beginning on the sixty-first (61st) Business Day after the Effective Date and ending upon such registration statement being declared effective by the Commission, and during any other period when the Company shall fail to have maintained an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, to exercise such Warrants on a “cashless basis,” by exchanging the Warrants (in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption) for that number of Ordinary Shares equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “Fair Market Value” (as defined below) over the Warrant Price by (y) the Fair Market Value and (B) 0.361.
Solely for purposes of this subsection 7.4.1, “Fair Market Value” shall mean the volume-weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the date that notice of exercise is received by the Warrant Agent from the holder of such Warrants or its securities broker or intermediary.
In connection with the “cashless exercise” of a Public Warrant, the Company shall, upon request, provide the Warrant Agent with an opinion of counsel for the Company (which shall be an outside law firm with securities law experience) stating that (i) the exercise of the Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with this subsection 7.4.1 is not required to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) the Ordinary Shares issued upon such exercise shall be freely tradable under United States federal securities laws by anyone who is not an affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company and, accordingly, shall not be required to bear a restrictive legend.
Except as provided in subsection 7.4.2, for the avoidance of doubt, unless and until all of the Warrants have been exercised or have expired, the Company shall continue to be obligated to comply with its registration obligations under the first three sentences of this subsection 7.4.1.
If the Ordinary Shares are at the time of any exercise of a Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, (i) require holders of Public Warrants who exercise Public Warrants to exercise such Public Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act as described in subsection 7.4.1 and (ii) in the event the Company so elects, the Company shall (x) not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and (y) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify for sale the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrant under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
