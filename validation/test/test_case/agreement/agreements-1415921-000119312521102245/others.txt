Alternative basis of interest or funding If a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Agent or the Borrowers so require, the Agent and the Borrowers shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than twenty (20) days (the “Negotiation Period”)) after the giving of the relevant Determination Notice with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.

Application of prepayment: The provisions of Clause 4 (Repayment and Prepayment) shall apply in relation to the prepayment made hereunder.

The following further provisions shall have effect in relation to any Transfer Certificate: a Transfer Certificate may be in respect of a Lender’s rights in respect of all, or part of, its Commitment and shall be in respect of the same proportion of its Contribution; a Transfer Certificate shall only be in respect of rights and obligations of the Transferor Lender in its capacity as a Lender and shall not transfer its rights and obligations (if applicable) as the Agent and/or Security Trustee, or in any other capacity, as the case may be and such other rights and obligations may only be transferred in accordance with any applicable provisions of this Agreement; a Transfer Certificate shall take effect in accordance with English law as follows: to the extent specified in the Transfer Certificate, the Transferor Lender’s payment rights and all its other rights (other than those referred to in clause 15.3.2 above) under this Agreement are assigned to the Transferee Lender absolutely, free of any defects in the Transferor Lender’s title and of any rights or equities which the Borrowers had against the Transferor Lender and the Transferee Lender assumes all obligations of the Transferor Lender as are transferred by such Transfer Certificate; the Transferor Lender’s Commitment is discharged to the extent specified in the Transfer Certificate; the Transferee Lender becomes a Lender with a Contribution and/or a Commitment in respect of the Loan of the amounts specified in the Transfer Certificate; the Transferee Lender becomes bound by all the provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents which are applicable to the Lenders generally, including those about pro-rata sharing and the exclusion of liability on the part of, and the indemnification of, the Agent and the Security Trustee and to the extent that the Transferee Lender becomes bound by those provisions, the Transferor Lender ceases to be bound by them; the Loan or part of the Loan which the Transferee Lender makes after the Transfer Certificate comes into effect ranks in point of priority and security in the same way as it would have ranked had it been made by the Transferor Lender, assuming that any defects in the Transferor Lender’s title and any rights or equities of any Security Party against the Transferor Lender had not existed; and the Transferee Lender becomes entitled to all the rights under this Agreement which are applicable to the Lenders generally, including but not limited to those relating to the Majority Lenders and those under clauses 3.6, 5 and 12 and to the extent that the Transferee Lender becomes entitled to such rights, the Transferor Lender ceases to be entitled to them; the rights and equities of the Borrowers or of any other Security Party referred to above include, but are not limited to, any right of set-off and any other kind of cross-claim; and the Borrowers, the Account Bank, the Security Trustee, the Agent and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorise and instruct the Agent to sign any such Transfer Certificate on their behalf and undertake not to withdraw, revoke or qualify such authority or instruction at any time.
84
Reliance on Transfer Certificate The Agent shall be entitled to rely on any Transfer Certificate believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been presented or signed by the persons by whom it purports to have been presented or signed, and shall not be liable to any of the parties to this Agreement and the Security Documents for the consequences of such reliance.
The entries on the said register shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive in determining the identities of the Commitments, the Contributions and the Transfer Certificates held by the Lenders from time to time and the principal amounts of such Transfer Certificates and may be relied upon by all parties to this Agreement.
Transfer fees and expensesAny Transferor Lender who causes the transfer of all or any part of its rights, benefits and/or obligations under the Security Documents in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this clause 15, must, on each occasion, pay to the Agent a transfer fee of three thousand Dollars (USD3,000) and, in addition, be responsible for all other costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees and expenses) associated therewith and all value added tax thereon, as well as those of the Agent (in addition to its fee as aforesaid) in connection with such transfer.
Documenting transfersIf any Lender assigns all or any part of its rights or transfers all or any part of its rights, benefits and/or obligations as provided in clause 15.3, each Borrower undertakes, immediately on being requested to do so by the Agent and at the cost of the Transferor Lender, to enter into, and procure that the other Security Parties shall (at the cost of the Transferor Lender) enter into, such documents as may be necessary or desirable to transfer to the Transferee Lender all or the relevant part of such Lender’s interest in the Security Documents and all relevant references in this Agreement to such Lender shall thereafter be construed as a reference to the Transferor Lender and/or its Transferee Lender (as the case may be) to the extent of their respective interests.
Sub-Participation, securitisation, subrogation assignment A Lender may sub-participate or include in a securitisation or similar transaction all or any part of its rights and/or obligations under or in connection with the Security Documents without the prior consent of the Borrowers, any Security Party, the Agent or the Security Trustee and the Lenders may assign, in any manner and terms all or any part of those rights to an insurer or surety who has become subrogated to them.
85
The Borrowers shall, and shall procure that each Security Party shall, do everything desirable or necessary to assist the Lenders (or any of them) to achieve a successful (in the opinion of the Lender concerned) securitisation (or similar transaction) or any sub-participation or subrogation assignment.
Disclosure of information A Bank may disclose to any of its branches and affiliates, its head office, any relevant fiscal authorities a prospective assignee, transferee or to any other person who may propose entering into contractual relations with such Bank in relation to this Agreement such information about the Borrowers and/or the other Security Parties and/or the Loan and/or the Security Documents as such Bank shall consider appropriate in relation to any transfer and/or enforcement hereunder.
The Lenders agree to treat all confidential information as “confidential” and not to disclose it to anyone, other than to any potential assignee or transferee or to any of their affiliates and affiliated funds and any of their officers, directors, employees, professional advisers, auditors, partners and representative, to any court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental, banking, taxation or other regulatory authority or similar body, or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation; and also agree to ensure that all confidential information is protected with security measures and degree of care that would apply to their own confidential information.
The Lenders further acknowledge that some or all of the confidential information is or may be price-sensitive information and that the use of such information may be regulated or prohibited by applicable legislation including securities law relating to insider dealing and market abuse and the Lenders undertakes not to use any confidential information for any unlawful purpose.
ARRANGER, AGENT AND SECURITY TRUSTEE Appointment of the AgentEach Lender irrevocably appoints the Agent as its agent for the purposes of this Agreement and such of the Security Documents to which it may be appropriate for the Agent to be party.
Accordingly each of the Lenders hereby authorises the Agent: to execute such documents as may be approved by the Majority Lenders for execution by the Agent; and (whether or not by or through employees or agents) to take such action on such Lender’s behalf and to exercise such rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to the Agent by any Security Document, together with such powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto.
86
Agent’s actionsAny action taken by the Agent under or in relation to any of the Security Documents whether with requisite authority or on the basis of appropriate instructions received from the Majority Lenders (or as otherwise duly authorised) shall be binding on all the Banks.
Security Trustee’s and Agent’s rightsThe Security Trustee and the Agent may: in the exercise of any right, remedy, power or discretion in relation to any matter, or in any context, not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any of the other Security Documents, act or, as the case may be, refrain from acting (or authorise the Security Trustee to act or refrain from acting) in accordance with the instructions of the Lenders, and shall be fully protected in so doing; unless and until it has received directions from the Majority Lenders, take such action or, as the case may be, refrain from taking such action (or authorise the Security Trustee to take or refrain from taking such action) in respect of a Default of which the Agent has actual knowledge as it shall consider advisable in the best interests of the Lenders (but shall not be obliged to do so); refrain from acting (or authorise the Security Trustee to refrain from acting) in accordance with any instructions of the Lenders to institute any Proceedings arising out of or in connection with any of the Security Documents until it and/or the Security Trustee has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against any and all costs, expenses or liabilities (including legal fees) which it would or might incur as a result; deem and treat (i) each Lender as the person entitled to the benefit of the Contribution of such Lender for all purposes of this Agreement unless and until a notice shall have been filed with the Agent pursuant to clause 15.3 and shall have become effective, and (ii) the office set opposite the name of each of the Lenders in schedule 1 as its lending office unless and until a written notice of change of lending office shall have been received by the Agent and the Agent may act upon any such notice unless and until the same is superseded by a further such notice; 87
rely as to matters of fact which might reasonably be expected to be within the knowledge of any Security Party upon a certificate signed by any officer of the relevant Security Party on behalf of the relevant Security Party; and do anything which is in its opinion necessary or desirable to comply with any law or regulation in any jurisdiction.
No Liability of Agent or ArrangerNeither of the Security Trustee, the Agent nor any of their respective employees and agents shall: be obliged to make any enquiry as to the use of any of the proceeds of the Loan unless (in the case of the Agent) so required in writing by a Lender, in which case the Agent shall promptly make the appropriate request to the Borrowers; or be obliged to make any enquiry as to any breach or default by the Borrowers or any other Security Party in the performance or observance of any of the provisions of the Security Documents or as to the existence of a Default unless (in the case of the Agent) the Agent has actual knowledge thereof or has been notified in writing thereof by a Bank, in which case the Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the relevant event or circumstance; or be obliged to enquire whether or not any representation or warranty made by the Borrowers or any other Security Party pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Security Documents is true; or be obliged to do anything (including, without limitation, disclosing any document or information) which would, or might in its opinion, be contrary to any law or regulation or be a breach of any duty of confidentiality or otherwise be actionable or render it liable to any person; or be obliged to account to any Lender for any sum or the profit element of any sum received by it for its own account; or be obliged to institute any Proceedings arising out of or in connection with any of the Security Documents other than on the instructions of the Majority Lenders; or be liable to any Lender for any action taken or omitted under or in connection with any of the Security Documents unless caused by its gross negligence or wilful misconduct.For the purposes of this clause 16, neither of the Security Trustee, the Arranger or the Agent shall be treated as having actual knowledge of any matter of which the corporate finance or any other division outside the agency or loan administration department of the Arranger, the Security Trustee or the Agent or the person for the time being acting as the Arranger, the Security Trustee or the Agent may become aware in the context of corporate finance, advisory or lending activities from time to time undertaken by the Arranger, the Security Trustee or the Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee or Agent for any Security Party or any other person which may be a trade competitor of any Security Party or may otherwise have commercial interests similar to those of any Security Party.
88
Non–reliance on Arranger, Security Trustee or AgentEach Lender acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, opinion, forecast or other representation made by the Arranger, the Security Trustee or the Agent to induce it to enter into any of the Security Documents and that it has made and will continue to make, without reliance on the Arranger, the Security Trustee or the Agent and based on such documents as it considers appropriate, its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Security Parties and its own independent investigation of the financial condition, prospects and affairs of the Security Parties in connection with the making and continuation of such Lender’s Commitment or Contribution under this Agreement.
None of the Arranger, the Security Trustee and the Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect to any Security Party whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loan or at any time or times thereafter other than as provided in clause 16.3.1.
No responsibility on Arranger, Security Trustee or Agent for Borrowers’ performanceNone of the Arranger, the Security Trustee or the Agent shall have any responsibility or liability to any Lender: on account of the failure of any Security Party to perform its obligations under any of the Security Documents; or for the financial condition of any Security Party; or for the completeness or accuracy of any statements, representations or warranties in any of the Security Documents or any document delivered under any of the Security Documents; or for the execution, effectiveness, adequacy, genuineness, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of any of the Security Documents or of any certificate, report or other document executed or delivered under any of the Security Documents; or to investigate or make any enquiry into the title of the Borrowers or any other Security Party to the Vessels or any other security or any part thereof; or for taking or omitting to take any other action under or in relation to any of the Security Documents or any aspect of any of the Security Documents; or on account of the failure of the Security Trustee to perform or discharge any of its duties or obligations under the Security Documents; or otherwise in connection with the Security Documents or their negotiation or for acting (or, as the case may be, refraining from acting) in accordance with the instructions of the Lenders.
Reliance on documents and professional adviceEach of the Arranger, the Security Trustee and the Agent shall be entitled to rely on any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person and shall be entitled to rely as to legal or other professional matters on opinions and statements of any legal or other professional advisers selected or approved by it (including those in the Arranger’s, Security Trustee’s or Agent’s employment).
89
Other dealingsEach of the Arranger, the Security Trustee and the Agent may, without any liability to account to the Lenders, accept deposits from, and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with, and provide advisory or other services to, any Security Party or any company in the same group of companies as such Security Party or any of the Lenders as if it were not the Arranger, the Security Trustee or Agent.
Rights of Agent, Agent as Lender; no partnershipWith respect to its own Commitment and Contribution (if any) the Security Trustee and the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Security Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the duties and functions delegated to it under this Agreement and the term “Lenders” shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Security Trustee and the Agent in their respective individual capacity as a Lender.
This Agreement shall not be construed so as to constitute a partnership between the parties or any of them.
Amendments and waivers Subject to clause 16.11, the Arranger, the Security Trustee and/or the Agent (as the case may be) may, with the consent of the Majority Lenders (or if and to the extent expressly permitted by the other provisions of any of the Security Documents) and, if so instructed by the Majority Lenders, shall: agree (or authorise the Security Trustee to agree) amendments or modifications to any of the Security Documents with the Borrowers and/or any other Security Party; and/or vary or waive breaches of, or defaults under, or otherwise excuse performance of, any provision of any of the other Security Documents by the Borrowers and/or any other Security Party (or authorise the Security Trustee to do so).Any such action so authorised and effected by the Agent shall be documented in such manner as the Security Trustee and/or the Agent (as the case may be) shall (with the approval of the Majority Lenders) determine, shall be promptly notified to the Lenders by the Security Trustee and/or the Agent (as the case may be) and (without prejudice to the generality of clause 16.2) shall be binding on the Lenders.
Except with the prior written consent of the Lenders, the Security Trustee and the Agent shall have no authority on behalf of the Lenders to agree (or authorise the Security Trustee to agree) with the Borrowers and/or any other Security Party any amendment or modification to any of the Security Documents or to grant (or authorise the Security Trustee to grant) waivers in respect of breaches or defaults or to vary or excuse (or authorise the Security Trustee to vary or excuse) performance of or under any of the Security Documents by the Borrowers and/or any other Security Party, if the effect of such amendment, modification, waiver or excuse would be to: 90
reduce the Margin, postpone the due date or reduce the amount of any payment of principal, interest or other amount payable by any Security Party under any of the Security Documents; change the currency in which any amount is payable by any Security Party under any of the Security Documents; increase any Lender’s Commitment; extend any Maturity Date; change any provision of any of the Security Documents which expressly or impliedly requires the approval or consent of all the Lenders such that the relevant approval or consent may be given otherwise than with the sanction of all the Lenders; change the order of distribution under clauses 6.10 and 13.1; change this clause 16.11; change the definition of “Majority Lenders” in clause 1.2; release any Security Party from the security constituted by any Security Document (except as required by the terms thereof or by law) or change the terms and conditions upon which such security or guarantee may be, or is required to be, released.
Reimbursement and indemnity by LendersEach Lender shall reimburse the Security Trustee and the Agent (rateably in accordance with such Lender’s Commitment or, after the Loan has been drawn, its Contribution,) to the extent that the Security Trustee or the Agent is not reimbursed by the Borrowers, for the costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Security Trustee or the Agent which are expressed to be payable by the Borrowers under clause 5.3 including (in each case), without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal or other professional advisers provided that, if following any payment to the Security Trustee or the Agent by a Lender under this clause the Security Trustee or the Agent receives payment from the Borrowers in respect of the same costs, fees or expenses, the Security Trustee or the Agent shall upon receipt thereof reimburse the relevant Lender.
Each Lender must on demand indemnify the Security Trustee or the Agent (rateably in accordance with such Lender’s Commitment or, after the Loan has been drawn, its Contribution) against all liabilities, damages, costs and claims whatsoever incurred by the Security Trustee in connection with any of the Security Documents or the performance of its duties under any of the Security Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Security Trustee or, as the case may be, the Agent, under any of the Security Documents, unless such liabilities, damages, costs or claims arise from the Security Trustee’s or as the case may be, the Agent’s own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
91
Prior to any such successor being appointed, the Agent agrees to consult with the Borrowers and the Lenders as to the identity of the proposed successor and to take account of any reasonable objections which the Borrowers and the Lenders may raise to such successor being appointed.
If the Majority Lenders, acting reasonably, are of the opinion that the Security Trustee or Agent is unable to fulfil its respective obligations under this Agreement in a professional and acceptable manner, then they may require the Security Trustee or Agent, by written notice, to resign in accordance with clause 16.13.1, which the Agent shall promptly do, and the terms of clause 16.13.1 shall apply to the appointment of any substitute Security Trustee or Agent, save that the same shall be appointed by the Majority Lenders and not by all of the Lenders.
Upon any such successor as aforesaid being appointed, the retiring Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee shall be discharged from any further obligation under the Security Documents (but shall continue to have the benefit of this clause 16 in respect of any action it has taken or refrained from taking prior to such discharge) and its successor and each of the other parties to this Agreement shall have the same rights and obligations among themselves as they would have had if such successor had been a party to this Agreement in place of the retiring Agent or Security Trustee.
Appointment and retirement of Security Trustee AppointmentEach of the Banks irrevocably appoints the Security Trustee as its Security Trustee and trustee for the purposes of the Security Documents, in each case on the terms set out in this Agreement.
Accordingly, each of the Lenders and the Agent hereby authorises the Security Trustee 92
(whether or not by or through employees or agents) to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to the Security Trustee by this Agreement and/or the Security Documents, together with such powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Prior to any such successor being appointed, the Security Trustee agrees to consult with the Borrowers as to the identity of the proposed successor and to take account of any reasonable objections which the Borrowers may raise to such successor being appointed.Upon any such successor as aforesaid being appointed, the retiring Security Trustee shall be discharged from any further obligation under the Security Documents (but shall continue to have the benefit of this clause 16 in respect of any action it has taken or refrained from taking prior to such discharge) and its successor and each of the other parties to this Agreement shall have the same rights and obligations among themselves as they would have had if such successor had been a party to this Agreement in place of the retiring Security Trustee.
93
Powers and duties of the Security Trustee The Security Trustee shall have no duties, obligations or liabilities to any of the Lenders and the Agent beyond those expressly stated in any of the Security Documents.
Subject to clause 16.15.3 the Security Trustee may, with the prior consent of the Majority Lenders communicated in writing by the Agent, concur with any of the Security Parties to: amend, modify or otherwise vary any provision of the Security Documents to which the Security Trustee is or is intended to be a party; or waive breaches of, or defaults under, or otherwise excuse performance of, any provision of the Security Documents to which the Security Trustee is or is intended to be a party; or give any consents to any Security Party in respect of any provision of any Security Document.Any such action so authorised and effected by the Security Trustee shall be promptly notified to the Lenders and the Agent by the Security Trustee and shall be binding on the other Banks.
The Security Trustee shall not concur with any Security Party with respect to any of the matters described in clause 16.11.4 without the consent of the Lenders communicated in writing by the Agent.
The Security Trustee shall (subject to the other provisions of this clause 16) take such action or, as the case may be, refrain from taking such action, with respect to any of its rights, powers and discretions as Security Trustee and trustee, as the Agent may direct.
Subject as provided in the foregoing provisions of this clause, unless and until the Security Trustee has received such instructions from the Agent, the Security Trustee may, but shall not be obliged to, take (or refrain from taking) such action under or pursuant to the Security Documents referred to in clause 16.14 as the Security Trustee shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks provided that (for the avoidance of doubt), to the extent that this clause might otherwise be construed as authorising the Security Trustee to take, or refrain from taking, any action of the nature referred to in clause 16.15.2—and for which the prior consent of the Lenders is expressly required under clause 16.15.3—clauses 16.15.2 and 16.15.3 shall apply to the exclusion of this clause.
94
None of the Lenders nor the Agent shall have any independent power to enforce any of the Security Documents referred to in clause 16.14 or to exercise any rights, discretions or powers or to grant any consents or releases under or pursuant to such Security Documents or any of them or otherwise have direct recourse to the security and/or guarantees constituted by such Security Documents or any of them except through the Security Trustee.
For the purpose of this clause 16, the Security Trustee may, rely and act in reliance upon any information from time to time furnished to the Security Trustee by the Agent (whether pursuant to clause 16.15.7 or otherwise) unless and until the same is superseded by further such information, so that the Security Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility to any party as a consequence of placing reliance on and acting in reliance upon any such information unless the Security Trustee has actual knowledge that such information is inaccurate or incorrect.
Without prejudice to the foregoing each of the Agent and the Lenders (whether directly or through the Agent) shall provide the Security Trustee with such written information as it may reasonably require for the purpose of carrying out its duties and obligations under the Security Documents referred to in clause 16.14.
Trust provisions The trusts constituted or evidenced in or by this Agreement and the Trust Deed shall remain in full force and effect until whichever is the earlier of: the expiration of a period of eighty (80) years from the Execution Date; and receipt by the Security Trustee of confirmation in writing by the Agent that there is no longer outstanding any Indebtedness (actual or contingent) which is secured or guaranteed or otherwise assured by or under any of the Security Documents,and the parties to this Agreement declare that the perpetuity period applicable to this Agreement and the trusts declared by the Trust Deed shall for the purposes of the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 be the period of eighty (80) years from the Execution Date.
In its capacity as trustee in relation to the Security Documents specified in clause 16.14, the Security Trustee shall, without prejudice to any of the powers, discretions and immunities conferred upon trustees by law (and to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of any of those Security Documents), have all the same powers and discretions as a natural person acting as the beneficial owner of such property and/or as are conferred upon the Security Trustee by any of those Security Documents.
It is expressly declared that, in its capacity as trustee in relation to the Security Documents specified in clause 16.14, the Security Trustee shall be entitled, subject to the consent of the Lenders, to invest moneys forming part of the security and which, in the opinion of the Security Trustee, may not be paid out promptly following receipt in the name or under the control of the Security Trustee in any of the investments for the time being authorised by law for the investment by trustees of trust moneys or in any other property or investments whether similar to the aforesaid or not or by placing the same on deposit in the name or under the control of the Security Trustee as the Security Trustee may think fit without being under any duty to diversify its investments and the Security Trustee may at any time vary or transpose any such property 95
 Independent action by BanksNone of the Banks shall enforce, exercise any rights, remedies or powers or grant any consents or releases under or pursuant to, or otherwise have a direct recourse to the security and/or guarantees constituted by any of the Security Documents without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders but, provided such consent has been obtained, it shall not be necessary for any other Bank to be joined as an additional party in any Proceedings for this purpose.
Common Agent and Security TrusteeThe Agent and the Security Trustee have entered into the Security Documents in their separate capacities (a) as agent for the Lenders under and pursuant to this Agreement (in the case of the Agent) and (b) as Security Trustee and trustee for the Lenders and the Agent under and pursuant to this Agreement, to hold the guarantees and/or security created by the Security Documents specified in clause 16.14 on the terms set out in such Security Documents (in the case of the Security Trustee).
If and when the Agent and the Security Trustee are the same entity and any Security Document provides for the Agent to communicate with or provide instructions to the Security Trustee (and vice versa), all parties to this Agreement agree that any such communications or instructions on such occasions are unnecessary and are hereby waived.
Co-operation to achieve agreed priorities of applicationThe Lenders and the Agent shall co-operate with each other and with the Security Trustee and any receiver under the Security Documents in realising the property and assets subject to the Security Documents and in ensuring that the net proceeds realised under the Security Documents after deduction of the expenses of realisation are applied in accordance with clause 13.1.
The Prompt distribution of proceedsMoneys received by any of the Banks (whether from a receiver or otherwise) pursuant to the exercise of (or otherwise by virtue of the existence of) any rights and powers under or pursuant to any of the Security Documents shall (after providing for all costs, charges, expenses and liabilities and other payments ranking in priority) be paid to the Agent for distribution (in the case of moneys so received by any of the Banks other than the Agent or the Security Trustee) and shall be distributed by the Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee (in the case of moneys so received by the Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee) in each case in accordance with clause 13.1.
The Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee shall make each such application and/or distribution as soon as is practicable after the relevant moneys are received by, or otherwise become available to, the Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee save that (without prejudice to any other provision contained in any of the Security Documents) the Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) or any receiver may credit any moneys received by it to a suspense account for so long and in such manner as the Agent or such receiver may from time to time determine with a view to preserving the rights of the Agent and/or the Security Trustee and/or the Arranger and/or the Account Bank and/or the Lenders or any of them to provide for the whole of their respective claims against the Borrowers or any other person liable.
96
ReconventioningAfter consultation with the Borrowers and the Lenders and notwithstanding clause 16.11, the Agent shall be entitled to make such amendments to this Agreement as it may determine to be necessary to take account of any changes in market practices as a consequence of the European Monetary Union (whether as to the settlement or rounding of obligations, business days, the calculation of interest or otherwise whatsoever).
So far as possible such amendments shall be such as to put the parties in the same position as if the event or events giving rise to the need to amend this Agreement had not occurred.
Any amendment so made to this Agreement by the Agent shall be promptly notified to the other parties hereto and shall be binding on all parties hereto.
ExclusivityWithout prejudice to the Borrowers’ rights, in certain instances, to give their consent thereunder, clauses 15 and 16 are for the exclusive benefit of the Banks.
Any electronic communication made by and/or between the Banks or any of them and the Security Parties or any of them will be effective only when actually received in readable form and, in the case of any electronic communication made by the Borrowers or the Lenders to the Agent, only if it is addressed in such manner as the Agent shall specify for this purpose.
98
BORROWERS’ OBLIGATIONS Joint and severalRegardless of any other provision in any of the Security Documents, all obligations and liabilities whatsoever of the Borrowers herein contained are joint and several and shall be construed accordingly.
Each of the Borrowers agrees and consents to be bound by the Security Documents to which it becomes a party notwithstanding that the other Borrower may not do so or be effectually bound and notwithstanding that any of the Security Documents may be invalid or unenforceable against the other Borrower, whether or not the deficiency is known to any Bank.
Borrowers as principal debtorsEach Borrower acknowledges that it is a principal and original debtor in respect of all amounts which may become payable by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of any of the Security Documents and agrees that each Bank may continue to treat it as such, whether or not such Bank is or becomes aware that such Borrower is or has become a surety for the other Borrower.
IndemnityThe Borrowers undertake to keep the Banks fully indemnified on demand against all claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses arising from any failure of any Borrower to perform or discharge any purported obligation or liability of that Borrower which would have been the subject of this Agreement or any other Security Document had it been valid and enforceable and which is not or ceases to be valid and enforceable against the other Borrower on any ground whatsoever, whether or not known to any Bank including, without limitation, any irregular exercise or absence of any corporate power or lack of authority of, or breach of duty by, any person purporting to act on behalf of the other Borrower (or any legal or other limitation, whether under the Limitation Acts or otherwise or any disability or death, bankruptcy, unsoundness of mind, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, winding up, administration, receivership, amalgamation, reconstruction or any other incapacity of any person whatsoever (including, in the case of a partnership, a termination or change in the composition of the partnership) or any change of name or style or constitution of any Security Party)).
99
Liability unconditionalNone of the obligations or liabilities of the Borrowers under any Security Document shall be discharged or reduced by reason of: the death, bankruptcy, unsoundness of mind, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, administration, receivership, amalgamation, reconstruction or other incapacity of any person whatsoever (including, in the case of a partnership, a termination or change in the composition of the partnership) or any change of name or style or constitution of any Borrower or any other person liable; any Bank granting any time, indulgence or concession to, or compounding with, discharging, releasing or varying the liability of, any Borrower or any other person liable or renewing, determining, varying or increasing any accommodation, facility or transaction or otherwise dealing with the same in any manner whatsoever or concurring in, accepting, varying any compromise, arrangement or settlement or omitting to claim or enforce payment from any Borrower or any other person liable; or anything done or omitted which but for this provision might operate to exonerate the Borrowers or all of them.
Recourse to other securityNo Bank shall be obliged to make any claim or demand or to resort to any security or other means of payment now or hereafter held by or available to them for enforcing any of the Security Documents against any Borrower or any other person liable and no action taken or omitted by any Bank in connection with any such security or other means of payment will discharge, reduce, prejudice or affect the liability of the Borrowers under the Security Documents to which any of them is, or is to be, a party.

JURISDICTION Exclusive JurisdictionFor the benefit of the Banks, and subject to clause 20.4 below, the Borrowers hereby irrevocably agree that the courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction: to settle any disputes or other matters whatsoever arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and any disputes or other such matters arising in connection with the negotiation, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any part thereof, whether the alleged liability shall arise under the laws of England or under the laws of some other country and regardless of whether a particular cause of action may successfully be brought in the English courts; and to grant interim remedies or other provisional or protective relief.
Submission and service of processEach Borrower accordingly irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts.
101
Forum non conveniens and enforcement abroadEach Borrower: waives any right and agrees not to apply to the English court or other court in any jurisdiction whatsoever to stay or strike out any proceedings commenced in England on the ground that England is an inappropriate forum and/or that Proceedings have been or will be started in any other jurisdiction in connection with any dispute or related matter falling within clause 20.1; and agrees that a judgment or order of an English court in a dispute or other matter falling within clause 20.1 shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and may be enforced against them in the courts of any other jurisdiction.
Right of Security Trustee, but not Borrowers, to bring proceedings in any other jurisdiction Nothing in this clause 20 limits the right of any Lender to bring Proceedings, including third party proceedings, against any one or all Borrowers, or to apply for interim remedies, in connection with this Agreement in any other court and/or concurrently in more than one jurisdiction; the obtaining by any Lender of judgment in one jurisdiction shall not prevent such Lender from bringing or continuing proceedings in any other jurisdiction, whether or not these shall be founded on the same cause of action.
Enforceability despite invalidity of AgreementWithout prejudice to the generality of clause 13.9, the jurisdiction agreement contained in this clause 20 shall be severable from the rest of this Agreement and shall remain valid, binding and in full force and shall continue to apply notwithstanding this Agreement or any part thereof being held to be avoided, rescinded, terminated, discharged, frustrated, invalid, unenforceable, illegal and/or otherwise of no effect for any reason.
Effect in relation to claims by and against non-parties For the purpose of this clause “Foreign Proceedings” shall mean any Proceedings except proceedings brought or pursued in England arising out of or in connection with (i) or in any way related to any of the Security Documents or any assets subject thereto or (ii) any action of any kind whatsoever taken by any Bank pursuant thereto or which would, if brought by any or all of the Borrowers against the Banks, have been required to be brought in the English courts; no Borrower shall bring or pursue any Foreign Proceedings against any Bank and shall use its best endeavours to prevent persons not party to this Agreement from bringing or pursuing any Foreign Proceedings against any Bank; If, for any reason whatsoever, any Security Party and/or any person connected howsoever with any Security Party brings or pursues against any Bank any Foreign Proceedings, the Borrowers shall indemnify such Bank on demand in respect of any and all claims, losses, damages, demands, causes of action, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, legal costs) of whatsoever nature howsoever arising from or in connection with such Foreign Proceedings which such Bank (or the Agent on its behalf) certifies as having been incurred by it; 102
the Banks and the Borrowers hereby agree and declare that the benefit of this clause 20 shall extend to and may be enforced by any officer, employee, agent or business associate of any of the Banks against whom a Borrower brings a claim in connection howsoever with any of the Security Documents or any assets subject thereto or any action of any kind whatsoever taken by, or on behalf of or for the purported benefit of any Bank pursuant thereto or which, if it were brought against any Bank, would fall within the material scope of clause 20.1.
In those circumstances this clause 20 shall be read and construed as if references to any Bank were references to such officer, employee, agent or business associate, as the case may be.
