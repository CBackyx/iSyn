(c)The Designating Lender will act as the representative of any Substitute Affiliate Lender it nominates for all administrative purposes under this Agreement.
The Obligors, the Agent, the Security Trustee and the other Finance Parties will be entitled to deal only with the Designating Lender, except that payments will be made in respect of Designated Loans to the Facility Office of the Substitute Affiliate Lender.
In particular the Commitments of the Designating Lender will not be treated as reduced by the introduction of the Substitute Affiliate Lender for voting purposes under this Agreement or the other Finance Documents.
(d)Save as mentioned in paragraph (c) above, a Substitute Affiliate Lender will be treated as a Lender for all purposes under the Finance Documents and having a Commitment equal to the principal amount of all Designated Loans in which it is participating if and for so long as it continues to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender under this Agreement.

44
               would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Finance Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Finance Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(b)As used in this Clause 1.7, the following terms have the following meanings:(i)"BHC Act Affiliate" of a party means an "affiliate" (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C.
1841(k)) of such party.

§ 252.82(b); (ii) a "covered bank" as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.
§ 47.3(b); or (iii) a "covered FSI" as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.
§ 382.2(b).
(iii)"Default Right" has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.
§§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.
(iv)"QFC" has the meaning assigned to the term "qualified financial contract" in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C.

The Agent and the Security Trustee are each authorised and instructed by each Finance Party to execute any such amended or replacement Finance Document (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Company).
(i)Except as provided in paragraph (c) above, the terms applicable to any Additional Facility will be those agreed by the Additional Facility Lenders in respect of that Additional Facility and the Company.
If there is any inconsistency between any such term agreed in respect of an Additional Facility and any term of this Agreement, the
50
term agreed in respect of the Additional Facility shall prevail (without prejudice to paragraph (c) above).

(c)Subject to paragraph (f) below, until no amount is or may be outstanding under that Letter of Credit, withdrawals from the account referred to in paragraph (a) above may only be made to pay to the Issuing Bank amounts due and payable to the Issuing Bank by the Non-Acceptable L/C Lender under the Finance Documents in respect of that Letter of Credit.
62
(b)Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of Clause 1.2 (Construction) the Issuing Bank shall agree to the withdrawal of amounts up to the level of that cash cover from the account if:(i)the relevant Lender is no longer a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and has given notice to this effect to the Issuing Bank;(ii)the relevant Lender's obligations in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit are transferred to a New Lender that is not a Non-Acceptable Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or(iii)an Increase Lender has agreed to undertake the obligations in respect of the relevant Lenders’ L/C Proportion of the Letter of Credit.
(c)To the extent that a Borrower has complied with its obligations to provide cash cover in respect of a Letter of Credit in accordance with this Clause 7.5, the relevant Lender's L/C Proportion in respect of that Letter of Credit will remain (but that Lender's obligations in relation to that Letter of Credit may be satisfied in accordance with paragraph (d)(ii) of Clause 1.2 (Construction)).
However, the relevant Borrower's obligation to pay any Letter of Credit fee in relation to the relevant Letter of Credit to the Agent (for the account of that Lender) in accordance with paragraph
63
(b) of Clause 17.6 (Fees payable in respect of Letters of Credit) will be reduced proportionately as from the date on which it complies with that obligation to provide cash cover (and for so long as the relevant amount of cash cover continues to stand as collateral).
In this event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this Clause 8.2 will be required to participate in the Loan in the Base Currency (in an amount equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount, or in respect of a Rollover Loan, an amount equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount of the Rollover Loan that is due to be made) and its participation will be treated as a separate Loan denominated in the Base Currency during that Interest Period.8.3Agent's calculationsEach Lender's participation in a Loan will be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of Clause 5.4 (Lenders' participation).9.ANCILLARY FACILITIES9.1Type of FacilityAn Ancillary Facility may be by way of:(a)an overdraft facility;(b)a cheque clearing facility;(c)a guarantee, bonding, documentary or stand-by letter of credit facility;

65
The Agent shall promptly notify the Ancillary Lender and the other Lenders of the establishment of an Ancillary Facility.No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this Clause 9.2).
In such a case, the provisions of this Agreement with regard to amendments and waivers will apply.
(c)Subject to compliance with paragraph (b) above:(i)the Lender concerned will become an Ancillary Lender; and(ii)the Ancillary Facility will be available,with effect from the date agreed by the Company and the Ancillary Lender.9.3Terms of Ancillary Facilities(a)Except as provided below, the terms of any Ancillary Facility will be those agreed by the Ancillary Lender and the Company.

(c)If there is any inconsistency between any term of an Ancillary Facility and any term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail except for (i) Clause 38.3 (Day count convention) which shall not prevail for the purposes of calculating fees, interest or commission relating to an Ancillary Facility; (ii) an Ancillary Facility comprising more than one account where the terms of the Ancillary Documents shall prevail to the extent required to permit the netting of balances on those accounts; and (iii) where the relevant term of this Agreement would be contrary to, or inconsistent with, the
66
law governing the relevant Ancillary Document, in which case that term of this Agreement shall not prevail.
(d)Interest, commission and fees on Ancillary Facilities are dealt with in Clause 17.7 (Interest, commission and fees on Ancillary Facilities).9.4Repayment of Ancillary Facility(a)An Ancillary Facility shall cease to be available on the relevant Termination Date or such earlier date on which its expiry date occurs or on which it is cancelled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unless the Ancillary Outstandings in respect of such Ancillary Facility are cash covered or it is agreed between the relevant Ancillary Lender and the Company that such Ancillary Facility will continue independently of this Agreement.
(b)If an Ancillary Facility expires in accordance with its terms the Ancillary Commitment of the Ancillary Lender shall be reduced to zero (and its Commitment shall be increased accordingly) unless the Ancillary Outstandings in respect of such Ancillary Facility are cash covered or it is agreed between the relevant Ancillary Lender and the Company that such Ancillary Facility will continue independently of this Agreement.
(d)For the purposes of determining whether or not the Ancillary Outstandings under an Ancillary Facility mentioned in paragraph (c)(iii) above can be refinanced by a Utilisation:(i)the Commitment of the Ancillary Lender under the relevant Facility will be increased by the amount of its Ancillary Commitment; and(ii)the Utilisation may (so long as paragraph (c)(i) above does not apply) be made irrespective of whether an Event of Default or Default is outstanding or any other applicable condition precedent is not satisfied (but only to the extent that the proceeds are applied in refinancing those Ancillary Outstandings) and irrespective of whether Clause 4.4 (Maximum number of Utilisations) or paragraph (a)(iv) of Clause 5.2 (Completion of a Utilisation Request for Loans) applies.
67
(e)On the making of a Utilisation to refinance Ancillary Outstandings:(i)each Lender will participate in that Utilisation in an amount (as determined by the Agent) which will result as nearly as possible in the aggregate amount of its participation in the Utilisations then outstanding under the relevant Facility bearing the same proportion to the aggregate amount of the Utilisations then outstanding under the relevant Facility as its Commitment bears to the total Commitments under the relevant Facility; and(ii)the relevant Ancillary Facility shall be cancelled.
(f)In relation to an Ancillary Facility which comprises an overdraft facility where a Designated Net Amount has been established, the Ancillary Lender providing that Ancillary Facility shall only be obliged to take into account for the purposes of calculating compliance with the Designated Net Amount those credit balances which it is permitted to take into account by the then current law and regulations in relation to its reporting of exposures to the Financial Conduct Authority or other applicable regulatory authorities as netted for capital adequacy purposes.9.5Ancillary OutstandingsEach Borrower and each Ancillary Lender agrees with and for the benefit of each Lender that:(a)the Ancillary Outstandings under any Ancillary Facility provided by that Ancillary Lender shall not exceed the Ancillary Commitment applicable to that Ancillary Facility and where the Ancillary Facility is an overdraft facility comprising more than one account, Ancillary Outstandings under that Ancillary Facility shall not exceed the Designated Net Amount in respect of that Ancillary Facility; and(b)where all or part of the Ancillary Facility is an overdraft facility comprising more than one account, the Ancillary Outstandings (calculated on the basis that the words in brackets in paragraph (a) of the definition of that term were deleted) shall not exceed the Designated Gross Amount applicable to that Ancillary Facility.9.6Adjustment for Ancillary Facilities upon accelerationIn this Clause 9.6:“Outstandings” means, in relation to a Lender and a Facility, the aggregate of the equivalent in the Base Currency of (i) its participation in each Utilisation then outstanding under the relevant Facility (together with the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it as a Lender), and (ii) if the Lender is also an Ancillary Lender, the Ancillary Outstandings in respect of Ancillary Facilities provided by that Ancillary Lender (or its Affiliate) under the relevant Facility (together with the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it as an Ancillary Lender in respect of the Ancillary Facility).“Total Outstandings” means, in relation to a Facility, the aggregate of all Outstandings under that Facility.
68
as such Lender's Commitment bears to the total Commitments under the relevant Facility, each as at the date the notice is served under Clause 28.9 (Acceleration).
(b)If an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility is a contingent liability and that contingent liability becomes an actual liability or is reduced to zero after the original adjustment is made under paragraph (a) above, then each Lender and Ancillary Lender will make a further adjustment by corresponding transfers (to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the position they would have been in had the original adjustment been determined by reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the contingent liability.
(c)Prior to the application of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Clause 9.6, an Ancillary Lender that has provided an overdraft comprising more than one account under an Ancillary Facility shall set-off any liabilities owing to it under such overdraft facility against credit balances on any account comprised in such overdraft facility.
Each Borrower consents to all such information being released to the Agent and the other Finance Parties.9.8Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders(a)Subject to the terms of this Agreement, an Affiliate of a Lender may become an Ancillary Lender.
In such case, the Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single Lender whose Commitment is the amount set out opposite the relevant Lender's name in Part 2 of Schedule 1 (The Original Parties) and/or the amount of any Commitment transferred to or assumed by that Lender under this Agreement, to the extent (in each case) not cancelled, reduced or transferred by it under this Agreement.
For the purposes of calculating the Lender's Available Commitment under each Facility, the Lender's Commitment shall be reduced to the extent of the aggregate of the Ancillary Commitments of its Affiliates.
(c)An Affiliate of a Lender which becomes an Ancillary Lender shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as an Ancillary Lender and any person which so accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement shall, at the same time, become a party to this Agreement as an Ancillary Lender in accordance with clause 21.13 (Creditor/Creditor Representative Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
(d)If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and obligations to a New Lender (as defined in Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders)), its
69
Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.
(e)Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on an Ancillary Lender and the relevant Ancillary Lender is an Affiliate of a Lender which is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.9.9Affiliates of Borrowers(a)Subject to the terms of this Agreement, an Affiliate of a Borrower which is a member of the Group may with the approval of the relevant Lender become a borrower with respect to an Ancillary Facility.
(c)If a Borrower ceases to be a Borrower under this Agreement in accordance with Clause 31.3 (Resignation of a Borrower), any Affiliate designated as the Affiliate of such Borrower pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall cease to have any rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.
(d)Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.
(e)Any reference in this Agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower being under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower being under no obligations under any Finance Document or Ancillary Document.9.10Commitment amountsNotwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all times its Commitment under each Facility is not less than the aggregate of:(a)its Ancillary Commitment in respect of that Facility; and(b)the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate in respect of that Facility.
70
(b)Without prejudice to each Borrower's obligation under paragraph (a) above, if one or more Loans are to be made available to a Borrower:(i)on the same day that a maturing Loan is due to be repaid by that Borrower;(ii)in the same currency as the maturing Loan (unless it arose as a result of the operation of Clause 8.2 (Unavailability of a currency)); and(iii)in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing Loan,the aggregate amount of the new Loans shall be treated as if applied in or towards repayment of the maturing Loan so that:(A)if the amount of the maturing Loan exceeds the aggregate amount of the new Loans:(I)the relevant Borrower will only be required to pay an amount in cash in the relevant currency equal to that excess; and(II)each Lender's participation (if any) in the new Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender's participation (if any) in the maturing Loan and that Lender will not be required to make its participation in the new Loans available in cash; and(B)if the amount of the maturing Loan is equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the new Loans:(I)the relevant Borrower will not be required to make any payment in cash; and(II)each Lender will be required to make its participation in the new Loans available in cash only to the extent that its participation (if any) in the new Loans exceeds that Lender's participation (if any) in the maturing Loan and the remainder of that Lender's participation in the new Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender's participation in the maturing Loan.
(c)At any time when a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the maturity date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Loans then outstanding will be automatically extended to the relevant Termination Date in relation to the Facilities and will be treated as separate Loans (the “Separate Loans”) denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are outstanding.
71
(e)Interest in respect of a Separate Loan will accrue for successive Interest Periods selected by the Borrower by the time and date specified by the Agent (acting reasonably) and will be payable by that Borrower to the Defaulting Lender on the last day of each Interest Period of that Loan.
(f)The terms of this Agreement relating to Loans generally shall continue to apply to Separate Loans other than to the extent inconsistent with paragraphs (c) to (e) above, in which case those paragraphs shall prevail in respect of any Separate Loan.11.ILLEGALITY, VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION11.1IllegalityIf, after the date of this Agreement (or, if later, the date the relevant Lender became a Party), it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a Lender to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by this Agreement or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any Utilisation or it becomes after the date of this Agreement (or, if later, the date the relevant Lender became a Party) unlawful for any Affiliate of a Lender for that Lender to do so:(a)that Lender shall promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event and the Agent shall promptly notify the Company after receiving such notice;(b)upon the Agent notifying the Company, the Available Commitment of that Lender will be immediately reduced and cancelled to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or avoid the relevant unlawfulness; and(c)to the extent that the Lender’s participation has not been transferred pursuant to Clause 41.3(g)(vii) (Replacement or repayment of Lender), each Borrower shall repay that Lender's reduced or cancelled participation in the Utilisations made to that Borrower (or procure the transfer of that Lender’s participation at par to another Lender willing to accept such transfer) on the last day of the Interest Period for each Utilisation occurring after the Agent has notified the Company or, if earlier, the date specified by the Lender in the notice delivered to the Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by law) and that Lender’s corresponding Commitment(s) shall be cancelled in the amount of the participations repaid.11.2Illegality in relation to Issuing BankIf after the date of this Agreement (or, if later, the date the relevant Issuing Bank became a Party), it becomes unlawful for an Issuing Bank to issue or leave outstanding any Letter of Credit, then:(a)that Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event and the Agent shall promptly notify the Company after receiving such notice;(b)upon the Agent notifying the Company, the Issuing Bank, shall not be obliged to issue any Letter of Credit to the extent such issuance would be unlawful;(c)to the extent it would be unlawful for any such Letter of Credit to remain outstanding the Company shall procure that each Obligor shall use all reasonable endeavours to

SCHEDULE 4AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES1.Security Principles(a)The guarantees and Security to be provided will be given in accordance with the principles set out in this Schedule.
This Schedule addresses the manner in which the principles will impact on the guarantees and Security proposed to be taken in relation to this transaction.
(b)The principles in this Schedule embody recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and Security from members of the Group in their respective jurisdiction of incorporation.
In particular:(i)general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, fraudulent conveyance, "thin capitalisation" and “capital maintenance” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or Security or may require that the guarantee be limited by an amount or otherwise;(ii)notwithstanding any term of any Finance Document, no obligation under this Agreement or under any Finance Document of a U.S. Obligor may be, directly or indirectly, (A) secured by any assets of a CFC (including any shares held directly or indirectly by a CFC); or (B) secured by a pledge in excess of 65% of the share capital (measured by the total combined voting power of the issued and outstanding voting shares) of a CFC.
In no event shall any CFC Obligor grant or be permitted to grant Security over any assets of such CFC Obligor with respect to any obligation of a U.S. Obligor;(iii)in the case of any joint venture or non-wholly owned subsidiary all guarantees and security will be limited to comply with restrictions in the joint venture, shareholders' or other agreement or by law provided that the Company will use reasonable endeavours to avoid or overcome such restrictions;(iv)the Security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account whether, in the opinion of the Agent (acting reasonably), the cost to the Group of providing Security is disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Lenders (including where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only);(v)any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted or not prohibited by the Finance Documents and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant Transaction Security provided that reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant member of the Group if the relevant asset is material to the Group as a whole;(vi)members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Transaction Security Documents if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant member of the Group or that would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the
190
relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle;(vii)perfection of Security, when required, and other required legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable and, in any event, within the relevant time periods specified in the Finance Documents or, if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Finance Documents, within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection;(viii)unless granted under a global Transaction Security Document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable Obligor or under English law all Security (other than any Security granted over certain of its subsidiaries as agreed) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Obligor;(ix)only floating security will be granted over the hedging agreements entered into by members of the Group;(x)the Security Trustee will hold one set of security for all Lenders unless local law requires separate ranking security for different classes of debt; and(xi)no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto by the LSTA.For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed Security Principles, “cost” includes, but is not limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for the continuance of any Security, stamp duties, out-of-pocket expenses, and other fees and expenses directly incurred by the relevant grantor of Security or any of its direct or indirect owners, subsidiaries or Affiliates.2.Guarantors and Security(a)To the extent possible, each guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and each guarantee and Security will be for all liabilities of the relevant chargor under the Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the principles set out in this Schedule in each relevant jurisdiction.
(b)To the extent possible, all security shall be given in favour of the Security Trustee and not the Finance Parties individually.
"Parallel debt" provisions will be used where necessary.
To the extent possible, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any Lender transfers any of its participation in the Facilities to a new Lender.
(c)No guarantees or security shall be granted by an Excluded Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary.
(d)Security may only be granted over 65% of New Holdco’s share capital (measured by the total combined voting power of the issued and outstanding voting shares) and no security will be granted over the assets of New Holdco  and/or any Subsidiary of New Holdco (including for the avoidance of doubt over any shares of a Subsidiary of New Holdco).3.Terms of Security Documents
191
The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken as part of this transaction:(a)the Security will be first ranking to the extent possible;(b)Security will not be enforceable until an Acceleration Event occurs and is continuing;(c)rights of set off (other than for netting purposes) will not be exercisable until an Event of Default occurs and is continuing;(d)the provisions of each Transaction Security Document will not be unduly burdensome on the relevant Obligor or interfere unreasonably with the operation of its business, will be limited to those required by applicable local law to create or perfect security and will not impose commercial obligations;(e)in the Transaction Security Documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in any Finance Document including those relating to notices, costs and expenses, indemnities, tax gross-up, distribution of proceeds and release of security; representations and undertakings shall be included in the Transaction Security Documents only to the extent relating to title to assets or required by local law in order to create or perfect the security expressed to be created thereby;(f)security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those already secured;(g)the Transaction Security Documents should not operate so as to prevent transactions which are permitted or not prohibited under the Finance Documents.4.Bank Accounts(a)Except as otherwise provided in the Debt Documents, each Obligor shall, prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, be entitled to receive, withdraw or otherwise transfer any credit balance from time to time on any bank account over which security has been granted (other than any Assigned Account).
(b)No Obligor shall be entitled to receive, withdraw or otherwise transfer any credit balance from time to time on any Assigned Account except with the prior consent of the Security Trustee (acting reasonably) or as permitted or not prohibited pursuant to the terms of the Debt Documents.
(c)After the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, no Obligor shall be entitled to receive, withdraw or otherwise transfer any credit balance from time to time on any bank account over which security has been granted except with the prior consent of the Security Trustee (acting reasonably).
192
This provision does not apply to Assigned Accounts in respect of which notice will be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Existing Debenture.5.Fixed Assets(a)Except as otherwise provided in the Debt Documents, if an Obligor grants security over its fixed assets it shall, prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business.
(b)Subject to any requirements under the Existing Security Documents, no notice whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the fixed assets shall be prepared or given until an Acceleration Event occurs and is continuing.6.Insurance(a)Except as otherwise provided in the Debt Documents, if an Obligor grants security over its insurance policies it shall, prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, be free to deal with those policies in the course of its business.
This provision does not apply to an Insurance Policy (as that term is in the Existing Debenture) in respect of which notice will be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Existing Debenture.7.Intellectual PropertyExcept as otherwise provided in the Debt Documents, if an Obligor grants security over its intellectual property it shall, prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business (including allowing its intellectual property to lapse if no longer material to its business).8.Intercompany receivables(a)Except as otherwise provided in the Debt Documents, if an Obligor grants security over its intercompany receivables it shall, prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, be free to deal with those receivables in the course of its business.
Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection if the service of notice would prevent the Obligor from dealing with an intercompany receivable in the course of its business no notice of security shall be served until an Acceleration Event occurs and is continuing.
This provision does not apply to
193
intercompany receivables charged under the Existing Debenture in respect of which notice will be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Existing Debenture.9.Trade receivables(a)Except as otherwise provided in the Debt Documents, if an Obligor grants security over its trade receivables it shall, prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, be free to deal with those receivables in the course of its business.
(b)No notice of security may be served until an Acceleration Event occurs and is continuing.10.Shares(a)Fixed charges and/or pledges over shares in joint ventures, Unrestricted Subsidiaries or over minority interests shall not be required.
(b)The Transaction Security Document will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the entity whose shares are being secured and not by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Obligor granting the security.
(c)Until an Acceleration Event occurs and is continuing, the charging Obligor will be permitted to retain and to exercise the voting rights to any shares and the company whose shares have been charged will be permitted to pay dividends.
(d)Unless the restriction is required by law or regulation or such restriction is only applicable if certain conditions have not been met, the constitutional documents of the company whose shares have been charged will be amended to remove any restriction on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on the taking or enforcement of the security granted over them.11.Excluded assetsFor the avoidance of doubt, any assets excluded from the Transaction Security existing as of the date of this Agreement, including but not limited to, the Trafford Training Centre and Academy at Carrington, Manchester (title number GM785864), shall not be subject to any Transaction Security.12.Release of SecurityUnless required by local law the circumstances in which the security shall be released should not be dealt with in individual Transaction Security Documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be the same as those set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

SCHEDULE 14TABLE OF VALUES FOR X1.The value of X in any Financial Year will be the amount determined using the Champions League Adjustment Spreadsheet and set out in the row labelled “EBITDA” in the column corresponding to that Financial Year after the following adjustments (the “Adjustments”) have been made in the electronic version of the spreadsheet (and, for the avoidance of doubt, with no other adjustments):(a)the figure in the Total Match Day income row of the spreadsheet for a Financial Year (the “Relevant Year”) will be determined by: (i) adjusting the revenue in the line item entitled “European Cups” in the Annual Financial Statements for the most recent Financial Year in which the first team of MUFC participated in the Champions League (the “Previous Year”) to reflect any increase or decrease in ticket prices announced prior to the start of the Relevant Year that would be applicable in the Relevant Year; (ii) aggregating the amount described in paragraph (i) above with the revenue (increased or decreased for the then prevailing rate (RPI) of inflation or deflation) in the line items entitled “Hospitality – Match Day” and “Catering (match day)” (minus any intra-Group items) in the Annual Financial Statements for the Previous Year; (iii) dividing the sum of the amount described in paragraph (ii) by the number of Champions League matches played at the Stadium in the Previous Year; and (iv) multiplying the product of paragraph (iii) by four;(b)any increase or decrease in the Sterling Equivalent (as defined in Schedule 15 (Restrictive Covenants)) of media and sponsorship revenues that would have been received by the Group from UEFA in respect of the Champions League (or, in each case, any replacement body or competition) had the first team of MUFC finished third in the Premier League (or any replacement competition) and qualified for the first knock-out stage of the Champions League will be taken into account in calculating the figure in the row labelled “European TV & Radio” in the column corresponding to that Financial Year; and(c)any increase or decrease in the portion of revenue from the Specified Contracts described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition thereof (as applicable) (or any replacement contract) that is dependent on the first team of MUFC qualifying for the Champions League in a Financial Year will be taken into account in calculating the figure in the row labelled “Nike” (in relation to the Nike Agreement) and the row labelled “Adidas” (in relation to the adidas Agreement) in the column corresponding to that Financial Year.2.The add back in respect of each Financial Year shall be applied according to the following quarterly schedule:
221
SCHEDULE 15RESTRICTIVE COVENANTSDefined terms used in this Schedule shall have the meanings given to them in this Schedule 15 unless the context requires otherwise.
The provisions of this Schedule 15 are to be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without prejudice to the fact that this Agreement is governed by English law).1.Asset Sales1.1The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:(a)the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (measured as of the date of the definitive agreement with respect to such Asset Sale) of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and(b)at least 75 per cent.
of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.
For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:(i)any liabilities, as shown on the Company’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Facilities and any guarantee thereof) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation or indemnity agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from or indemnifies against further liability;(ii)any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;(iii)Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or preferred stock of an Obligor other than the Company, in each case that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries following such Asset Sale are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness or preferred stock in connection with such Asset Sale;(iv)consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or preferred stock of an Obligor other than the Company which is either repaid in full or cancelled in connection with such Asset Sale; and(v)any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in paragraphs (b) or (d) of Clause 1.2 below,provided that, in no event will the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of the Specified Asset other than to an Obligor.

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Excess Proceeds Prepayment Offer, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use those
223
Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.
If the aggregate principal amount of the Facilities, the Notes and any other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Facilities and any guarantee thereof tendered into (or required to be prepaid, redeemed or cancelled in connection with) such Excess Proceeds Prepayment Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, or if the aggregate principal amount of the Facilities exceeds the amount of Net Proceeds to be so applied, such Net Proceeds shall be allocated to prepay  the Facilities, such Notes and such other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Facilities and any guarantee thereof to be prepaid on a pro rata basis based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid, redeemed or cancelled.
For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in U.S.
Dollars, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their U.S. Dollar Equivalent determined as of the Business Day immediately prior to the date on which the Excess Proceeds Prepayment Offer is announced.
Upon completion of each Excess Proceeds Prepayment Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.2.Restricted Payments2.1The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:(a)declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company and other than dividends or distributions payable to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries);(b)purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company) any Equity Interests of the Company or any direct or indirect parent entity of the Company;(c)make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Obligor that is contractually subordinated to the Facilities and any guarantee thereof (excluding (i) any intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (ii) the purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Obligor that is contractually subordinated to the Facilities or the guarantee thereof purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement);(d)make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding; or(e)make any Restricted Investments,(all such payments and other actions set forth in the foregoing paragraphs (a) through (e) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

Indebtedness under the Facilities will be deemed to have been incurred under paragraph (a) of Clause 3.2 only.
The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Clause 3; provided, in each such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or payment is included in Consolidated Interest Expense of the Company as accrued.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 3, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this Clause 3 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.3.5The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:(a)the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;(b)the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness;(c)in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:(i)the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and(ii)the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person; and(d)for purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (i) if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than
232
sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; and (ii) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such currency agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such currency agreement.4.LiensThe Company will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, Permitted Liens and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.5.Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions5.1The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any sale and leaseback transaction with a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; provided that any Obligor may enter into a sale and leaseback transaction if:(a)such Obligor could have (i) incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt relating to such sale and leaseback transaction under the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test in paragraph (a) of Clause 3.1 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock) above and (ii) incurred a Lien to secure such Indebtedness pursuant to Clause 4 (Liens);(b)the gross cash proceeds of that sale and leaseback transaction are at least equal to the Fair Market Value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company of the property that is the subject of that sale and leaseback transaction; and(c)the transfer of assets in that sale and leaseback transaction is permitted by, and the Company applies the proceeds of such transaction in compliance with Clause 1 (Asset Sales).6.Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries6.1The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:(a)pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;
233
(b)make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or(c)sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.6.2The restrictions in Clause 6.1 above will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:(a)agreements governing Existing Indebtedness and the Facilities or any other agreement as in effect at or entered into on the Closing Date and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Closing Date;(b)the Existing Note Indenture, the Existing Notes and the Existing Note Guarantees, the Existing Facility Agreement, the Notes, the Note Guarantee, the BAML Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents;(c)agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Clause 3 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock) and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the restrictions therein are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the Finance Documents;(d)applicable law, rule, regulation or order;(e)any agreement or instrument of or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such agreement or instrument was entered into or incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition) and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of any such agreement or instrument, provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are (i) no more restrictive or (ii) not materially less favorable as determined in good faith by the Company, than the dividend and other payment restrictions contained in such instrument at the time of such acquisition, which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of this Agreement to be incurred;(f)customary non-assignment provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business;(g)purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in paragraph (c) of Clause 5 (Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions);(h)any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all of the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
234
that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;(i)Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;(j)Liens permitted to be incurred under Clause 4 (Liens) that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;(k)provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment) entered into with the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;(l)restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;(m)Hedging Obligations entered into from time to time;(n)any mortgage financing or mortgage refinancing that imposes restrictions on the real property (including any heritage building rights) securing such Indebtedness; and(o)agreements governing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (n) of Clause 3.2 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock) by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is an Excluded Subsidiary under paragraph (d) of the definition thereof, provided that any encumbrance or restriction in any such agreement is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any other Person, other than such Restricted Subsidiary or its property or assets.7.Merger, Consolidation, etc.7.1The Company and Red Football Junior Limited, will not, directly or indirectly: (x) consolidate or merge with or into another Person, whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation, or (y) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:(a)either:(i)the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or, as the case may be, MUL is the surviving corporation; or(ii)the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or MUL) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the laws of any Permitted Jurisdiction;(b)the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or MUL) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made assumes
235
all the obligations of the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or, as the case may be, MUL under the Finance Documents to which the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or MUL (as applicable) is a party pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders);(c)immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;(d)the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or MUL (as applicable) or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or MUL (as applicable), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, (i) would be permitted to incur at least £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in paragraph (a) of Clause 3.1 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock) or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was prior to such transaction; and(e)the Company delivers to the Agent an Officers’ Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and assumption of obligations under the Finance Documents comply with this Clause 7.1.7.2Except as otherwise provided in this Clause 7, no Obligor (other than an Obligor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with this Agreement) may sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Obligor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than a sale or disposal to, or consolidation or merger with or into, the Company or another Obligor unless:(a)either:(i)such Obligor is the surviving Person; or(ii)the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Obligor) (A) is organized under the laws of a Permitted Jurisdiction and (B) assumes all the obligations of that Obligor under the Finance Documents to which such Obligor is a party pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders),provided that, in either case, immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; or(b)in the case only of an Obligor that is not the Borrower, the Company or Red Football Junior Limited, the Net Proceeds of such sale are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Finance Documents.7.3In addition, no Obligor will, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.7.4Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither this Clause 7 nor Clause 11.2 will restrict the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of (a) the Company or any Obligor with, into or to any Obligor, (b) any non-Obligor Restricted Subsidiary with, into or to the Company or any Obligor or with, into or to any non-Obligor Restricted Subsidiary, (c) any Permitted Reorganisation and (d) paragraph (d) of Clause 7.1

238
(including without limitation, Sponsorship Newco) under Clause 3 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock).9.3Such Additional Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally be released under the same conditions and circumstances that the guarantee of other Indebtedness will be released, so long as no Default or Event of Default would arise as a result and no other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant Additional Guarantor that would have resulted in the requirement that such Additional Guarantor become an Additional Guarantor pursuant to this Clause 9.10.Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries10.1The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default.
If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Clause 2 (Restricted Payments) or under one or more paragraphs of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company.
That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
The Board of Directors of the Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.10.2Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Agent by filing with the Agent a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted under Clause 2 (Restricted payments).
If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Finance Documents and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Clause 3 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock) the Company will be in default of such covenant.
The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (i) such Indebtedness is permitted under Clause 3 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock) calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (ii) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.11.Limitation on Issuer Activities11.1The Issuer will not create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien over any of its property or assets, or any proceeds therefrom, to secure Indebtedness, except for Liens to secure the Existing Notes, the Existing RCF Facilities Agreement, the Notes, the BAML Facility, the Facility or other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Finance Documents to the extent Liens securing such Indebtedness are permitted to be incurred under the Finance Documents.11.2The Issuer will not (i) merge, consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving corporation) or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any material property or assets to any Person in
239
one or more related transactions, other than (A) in the case of clause (i) or clause (ii), in accordance with Section 7 hereof, or (B) solely in the case of clause (ii), in connection with the incurrence of a Permitted Collateral Lien.11.3Until the date on which all Commitments have been cancelled and all amounts outstanding under the Facility have been fully repaid, none of the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will commence or take any action or facilitate a winding-up, liquidation or other analogous proceeding in respect of the Issuer.12.Limitation on Holding Company Activities12.1The Company will not, at any time, own any assets or property other than cash and Cash Equivalents, the Carrington Premises, Capital Stock in Red Football Junior Limited and MUL, assets that will be used to make a Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted Investment) permitted by Clause 2 (Restricted Payments) promptly following receipt thereof by the Company and other assets that are de minimis in nature.12.2Red Football Junior Limited will not, at any time, own any assets or property other than Capital Stock in MUL and other assets that are de minimis in nature.12.3In addition, neither the Company nor Red Football Junior Limited will trade, undertake any activity, carry on any business, own any assets, enter into any arrangement or incur any liability other than:(a)the ownership of shares of MUL and, in the case of the Company, Red Football Junior Limited or any other direct Subsidiary of the Company and/or Red Football Junior Limited (an “Additional Subsidiary”) that is a member of the Group, in each case to the extent such shares are subject to Transaction Security and provided that any Additional Subsidiary is the only member of the Group (other than Red Football Junior Limited) in which the Company directly owns shares;(b)the provision of administrative services (excluding treasury services) to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the receipt of any amounts related thereto to the extent expressly permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;(c)incurring Indebtedness permitted under Clause 3 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock) (including activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of such Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible under the Finance Documents);(d)rights and obligations arising under the Debt Documents;(e)directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its corporate existence; or(f)the holding of bank accounts and the making of loans (including activities reasonably incidental thereto) permitted by the Finance Documents, and the entry into any agreement in relation thereto.
