7.8           Collateral Records.
The failure by Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries, however, to promptly give the Collateral Agent such statements or schedules shall not affect, diminish, modify or otherwise limit the Collateral Agent’s security interests (for the benefit of the Lenders) in the Collateral.
7.9           Security Interests.
Each of Holdings and the Borrower shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, defend the Collateral against all claims and demands of all Persons at any time claiming the same or any interest therein other than claims or demands pursuant to the Credit Documents.

The Collateral Agent is hereby authorized by Holdings and the Borrower to file or register any UCC and PPSA financing statements or similar instrument and amendments thereto, whether or not the signatures of Holdings or the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries appears thereon, that (i) indicate the Collateral (A) as “all assets” of such Person, or words of similar effect, regardless of whether any particular asset included in the Collateral falls within the scope of Article 9 of the UCC or the PPSA, or (B) as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail and (ii) contain any other information required by, inter alia, Part 5 of Article 9 of the UCC or the PPSA for the sufficiency or filing office acceptance of any financing statement or similar instrument or amendment, including (A) whether such Person is an organization, the type of organization, any organization identification number issued to such Person, and any employer or taxpayer identification number issued to such Person and (B) in the case of a financing statement filed or registered as a fixture filing or indicating any Collateral as as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, a sufficient description of real property to which such Collateral relates.

7.10         Insurance; Casualty Loss.
Holdings and the Borrower agree to maintain, and to cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain, public liability insurance, flood insurance, third party property damage insurance and replacement value (or such higher coverage as the Borrower may obtain) insurance on the Collateral under such policies of insurance, with such insurance companies, in such amounts and covering such risks in at least such amounts and against at least such risks as are described on Schedule XII or, with respect to any lesser coverages (whether as to the amount or scope of coverage), as are at all times satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in its commercially reasonable judgment.
All policies covering the Collateral are to name the Collateral Agent as an additional insured and the Collateral Agent as loss payee in case of loss, as its interests may appear, and are to contain such other provisions as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require to fully protect the Administrative Agent’s, the Collateral Agent’s and the Lenders’ interest in the Collateral and to any payments to be made under such policies.
With respect to each Casualty Loss, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, either apply such amounts (x) to the payment of the outstanding Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.5(g)(iii) or (y) to repair or replace the assets subject to the Casualty Loss or to purchase other assets of the same or similar type as those for which the Borrower or other applicable Credit Party received such insurance proceeds (although in the event that a Default or an Event of Default then exists, such amount shall be applied to repay outstanding Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.5(l) and, if required in accordance with the terms thereof, to reduce the Total Revolving Credit Commitments in accordance with Section 2.5(e)(v)).
Holdings, the Borrower and/or the respective Subsidiary shall diligently file and prosecute their claim or claims for any award or payment in connection with a Casualty Loss.
In the event of a Casualty Loss, if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall pay to the Collateral Agent, promptly upon receipt thereof, any and all net insurance proceeds and payments received by Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries on account of damage, destruction, loss, condemnation or eminent domain proceedings, which proceeds shall be applied as provided in the last parenthetical of the preceding sentence or as otherwise determined by the Required Lenders in their sole discretion).
Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and appoints the Collateral Agent its attorney-in-fact, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to collect and receive for any such award or payment and to file and prosecute such claim or claims, which power of attorney shall be irrevocable and shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest, and each of Holdings and the Borrower shall, upon demand of the
110
Each of Holdings and the Borrower will, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, pay and discharge all federal income and other material taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or profits, or upon any properties belonging to it, or payable by it pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreements, in each case on a timely basis, and all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become a Lien or charge upon any properties of Holdings, the Borrower or of any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, that none of Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim which is being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings diligently pursued if it has maintained adequate reserves (in the good faith judgment of the management of such Person) with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and which proceedings have the effect of preventing the forfeiture or sale of the property or asset subject to any related Lien (if any).
7.12         End of Fiscal Years; Fiscal Quarters.
Each of Holdings and the Borrower will, for financial reporting purposes, cause (i) each of their, and each of their respective Subsidiaries’, fiscal years to end on December 31 of each year and (ii) each of their and each of their respective Subsidiaries’, fiscal quarters to end on dates consistent therewith.
7.13         Further Assurances.
(a)  Holdings and the Borrower shall take, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to take, all such further actions and execute all such further documents and instruments as the Collateral Agent may at any time reasonably determine to be necessary or desirable to further carry out and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents, to cause the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents to be duly authorized and to perfect or protect the Liens (and the priority status thereof) of the Collateral Agent on the Collateral including, without limitation, (i) filing or registering notices of liens, UCC and PPSA financing statements and amendments, renewals and continuations thereof, (ii) obtaining, providing or making notations of security interests upon Unit Certificates, (iii) cooperating with the Collateral Agent’s representatives, keeping stock records, obtaining waivers from landlords and from warehousemen and their landlords and (iv) paying claims which might, if unpaid, become a Lien on the Collateral other than a Permitted Lien.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.13, the Collateral Agent shall not (except in the circumstances described in the second and third sentences of Section 11.19) request that the Borrower obtain or provide any Unit Certificates with respect to any Non-Qualified Units unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided that if any Unit Certificates are obtained, a notation of the Collateral Agent’s security interest shall be made thereon as required by Section 7.18(b).
All actions required to be taken pursuant to this Section 7.13, as well as pursuant to Section 11.19, shall be at the cost and expense of the Borrower.

7.14         Maintenance of Separateness.

In dealing with their respective creditors, none of Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall act in a manner which would cause its creditors to believe that any such Person was not a separate corporate entity from the other such Persons.
Without limiting the foregoing, the consolidated financial statements of each of Holdings and the Borrower shall, through appropriate footnote disclosure, indicate the assets from time to time held by the Unit Subsidiary, as opposed to Holdings or the Borrower, as the case may be, and their other Subsidiaries.
Furthermore, no Credit Party nor any of its
112
Subsidiaries shall take any action, or conduct its affairs in a manner, which would be reasonably likely to result in the separate existence of the Unit Subsidiary being ignored, or in the assets and liabilities of the Unit Subsidiary being substantively consolidated with those of any of Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Unit Subsidiary) in a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding.
Finally, the Credit Parties shall not permit the Unit Subsidiary to voluntarily incur any liabilities other than (i) the Unit Subsidiary’s Subsidiaries Guaranty, (ii) the guaranty by the Unit Subsidiary of the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes and the Indebtedness permitted under Section 8.3(n), in each instance, to the extent permitted under Sections 8.3(d), (l) and (n), respectively, and (iii) liabilities under the Unit Subsidiary Management Agreement, the Master Lease Agreements and the Custodian Agreement.

149
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, record any assignment in the Register on or after the date on which any proposed amendment, modification or supplement in respect of this Credit Agreement has been circulated to the Lenders for approval until the earlier of (x) the effectiveness of such amendment, modification or supplement in accordance with Section 11.10 or (y) 30 days following the date on which such proposed amendment, modification or supplement was circulated to the Lenders.
Upon the effectiveness of any assignment pursuant to clause (b)(A)(y), (x) the assignee will become a “Lender” for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents with the Loans and a Commitment as so recorded by the Administrative Agent in the Register, and to the extent of such assignment, the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to the portion of its Commitment being assigned and (y) the Borrower shall issue new Notes (in exchange for the Note or Notes of the assigning Lender) to the assigning Lender (to the extent such Lender’s Commitments and outstanding Loans are not reduced to zero as a result of such assignment) and to the assignee Lender, in each case to the extent requested by the assigning Lender or assignee Lender, as the case may be, to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments and outstanding Loans of such Lenders.
To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender’s rights and obligations hereunder would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased payment obligations under Section 2.9, 4.5 or 4.11 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased amounts (although the Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other increased amounts of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective assignment).
The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 11.6 other than those resulting from the Administrative Agent’s willful misconduct or gross negligence (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and unappealable decision).

Each Lender may transfer, grant or assign participations in all or any part of such Lender’s interests and obligations hereunder pursuant to this
150
clause (b)(B) to any Eligible Transferee, provided that (i) such Lender shall remain a “Lender” for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the transferee of such participation shall not constitute a Lender hereunder, (ii) no participant under any such participation shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such amendment or waiver would (x) extend the final scheduled maturity of any of the Loans or the Commitments in which such participant is participating (it being understood that a waiver of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitments or the waiver of the application of any prepayment to the Loans shall not constitute the extension of the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Commitment), (y) reduce the interest rate (other than as a result of waiving the applicability of any post-default increases in interest rates) or Fees or postpone the payment or reduce the amount thereof or (z) release all or substantially all of the Collateral (except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement.
In the case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant’s rights against the granting Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement with such Lender creating such participation) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, provided that such participant shall be entitled to receive additional amounts under Sections 2.9 (to the extent that such participant complies with such Section, including clause (b) thereof, as if it were a Lender), 2.10, 4.5 and 4.11 on the same basis as if it were a Lender to the extent that the Lender granting such participation would be entitled to such benefit if the participation had not been made.
In addition, each agreement creating any participation must include an agreement by the participant to be bound by the provisions of Section 11.7 of this Credit Agreement.

(a)  Each of Holdings and the Borrower shall, jointly and severally, and hereby agrees to jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Agent, the Issuing Lender and each of the Lenders and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, agents and employees (the “Indemnitees”) from and against (x) any and all losses, claims, damages, Taxes, liabilities or expenses incurred by any of them (except to the extent that it is finally judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the respective Indemnitee (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and unappealable decision)) arising out of or by reason of any litigations, investigations, claims or proceedings which arise out of or are in any way related to (i) this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) the issuance of Letters of Credit, (iii) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of any Loans or (iv) the Agents’ or the Lenders’ entering into this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any other agreements and documents relating hereto, including, without limitation, amounts paid in any settlement agreed to by Holdings or the Borrower, court costs and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such litigation, investigation, claim or proceeding or any advice rendered in
153
connection with any of the foregoing (whether or not such lender is a party thereto) and (y) any such losses, claims (including Environmental Claims), damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments, fees and disbursements (including reasonable attorneys’ and consultants’ fees and disbursements) or expenses incurred in connection with any removal, remedial or other action under any Environmental Laws taken by the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Lenders (except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the respective Indemnitee (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and unappealable decision)) or in connection with compliance by Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties, with any Environmental Laws or in connection with the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on any property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

Unless the Administrative Agent has received actual notice from any Lender that the conditions contained in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 have not been met, upon the satisfaction of the condition described in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence and upon the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that the conditions described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence have been met, then the Effective Date shall have been deemed to have occurred, regardless of any subsequent determination that one or more of the conditions thereto had not been met.
11.15       Headings Descriptive.
The headings of the several sections and subsections of this Credit Agreement, and the Table of Contents, are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Credit Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Credit Agreement or in any other Credit Document, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that all agreements among them under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money loaned to the Borrower and evidenced hereby or thereby or for the performance or payment of any covenant or obligation contained herein or therein, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
If due to any circumstance whatsoever, fulfillment of any provisions of this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents at the time performance of such provision shall be due shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, then, automatically, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be modified or reduced to the extent necessary to limit such interest to the Highest Lawful Rate, and if from any such circumstance any Lender should ever receive anything of value deemed interest by applicable law which would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, such excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount then outstanding hereunder or on account of any other then outstanding Obligations and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the principal unpaid balance then outstanding hereunder and such other then outstanding Obligations, such excess shall be refunded to the Borrower.
All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Administrative Agent or any
157
Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the Obligations and other Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such Indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on account of all such Indebtedness does not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate throughout the entire term of such Indebtedness.
The terms and provisions of this Section 11.16 shall control every other provision of this Credit Agreement and all agreements among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
11.17       Right of Setoff.
In addition to and not in limitation of all rights of offset that any Lender or the Issuing Lender may have under applicable law, each Lender and the Issuing Lender shall, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and whether or not such Lender or such Issuing Lender has made any demand or the Obligations of any Credit Party are matured, have the right, upon prior notice to Holdings or the Borrower, to appropriate and apply to the payment of the Obligations of Holdings or the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) then or thereafter held by and other Indebtedness or property then or thereafter owing by such Lender or such Issuing Lender, including, without limitation, any and all amounts in the Concentration Account or the Disbursement Account.
Each Lender or the Issuing Lender exercising such rights shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof and any amount received as a result of the exercise of such rights shall be reallocated among the Lenders and the Issuing Lender as set forth in Section 2.10 hereof; provided, however, that failure of the Borrower to receive such notice shall not impair any Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s rights hereunder.
The Lenders hereby authorize the Administra­tive Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into or otherwise become bound by the various Credit Documents (or amendments thereto) attached as exhibits to this Credit Agreement on their behalf.
11.19       Certain Provisions Regarding Perfection of Security Interests.
(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, the Lenders acknowledge and agree that, except to the extent that further actions are required to be taken in accordance with the terms of Section 7.13 of this Credit Agreement, (i) with respect to Non-Certificated Units from time to time held by the Unit Subsidiary, certificates of title have not been issued with respect thereto and, accordingly, no notation of a security interest has been made under the titling statutes of any State in connection therewith and (ii) with respect to Units from time to time leased to customers, “fixture filings” will not be made under the provisions of the UCC or the PPSA (or other applicable law) as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction, both because of the administrative difficulty of ascertaining whether any such Unit is or becomes a fixture and the inability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to provide the relevant information which would be required to make such filings.
Notwithstanding the penultimate sentence of Section 7.13, if the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries becomes aware that a Certificate of Title is required to be issued with respect to any Non-Certificated Unit under applicable law, the Borrower shall take all steps as may be necessary so that a certificate of title is issued with respect thereto, on which the security interest of the Collateral Agent is noted.
Furthermore, in the event the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders reasonably believes that Certificates of Title may be required to be issued in connection with Non-Certificated Units located in any jurisdiction, the Borrower shall promptly
158
(and in any event within 30 days after its receipt of the respective request) following a request by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, cause special counsel or special counsels designated by it (who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders) to issue, with respect to the laws of a requested jurisdiction or jurisdictions, an opinion in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders as to whether Certificates of Title are required to be issued with respect to any Non-Certificated Units under the laws of such jurisdiction or jurisdictions and, whether based thereon or upon the advice of their own counsel, if at any time the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders inform the Borrower that they in good faith believe that Certificates of Title are required to be issued with respect to any Non-Certificated Unit under applicable law and further request that the actions described in this sentence be taken, then the Borrower shall take all steps as may be necessary so that, within 90 days from the date of the respective request, a certificate of title is issued with respect thereto, on which the security interest of the Collateral Agent is noted; provided that unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders shall not, in any event, request an opinion with respect to any one jurisdiction more than once in a calendar year.
So long as Sections 7.18(a) and 8.12 of this Credit Agreement are complied with, the provisions of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to permit the foregoing (and so that no violation of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents exists or shall exist as a result of the actions permitted to be taken (or not taken) in accordance with the provisions of preceding clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 11.19 unless and until (and then to the extent) required to be taken in accordance with the two preceding sentences) (including, without limitation, all conditions precedent, representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements herein and therein).
159
11.20       Limitation of Liability.
NO CLAIM MAY BE MADE BY ANY CREDIT PARTY, ANY LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON PARTY HERETO AGAINST ANY AGENT, ANY LENDER OR THE AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, COUNSEL, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT OF ANY OF THEM FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT, OR ANY ACT, OMISSION OR EVENT OCCURRING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AND EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES, RELEASES AND AGREES NOT TO SUE UPON ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT ACCRUED AND WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO EXIST IN ITS FAVOR.
11.21       Acknowledgements Regarding Security Bond Obligations.
For greater certainty, and without limiting the powers of the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents, the Borrower hereby acknowledges that the Collateral Agent shall, for purposes of holding any security interest granted by any Credit Party in any of its property or assets pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec to secure obligations of such Credit Party under any debenture or bond (any such obligations, “Security Bond Obligations”), be the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (fondé de pouvoir) (within the meaning of the Civil Code of Quebec, as amended) for each Secured Creditor and in particular for all present and future holders of any debenture or bond (the Secured Creditors and any such holders, collectively, the “Secured Creditor Grantors”).
Each Security Creditor Grantor hereby constitutes, to the extent necessary, the Collateral Agent as the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (fondé de pouvoir) (within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec, as amended) in order to hold security granted by any Credit Party in the Province of Quebec to secure Security Bond Obligations.
Each assignee of any Secured Creditor Grantor shall be deemed to have confirmed and ratified the constitution of the Collateral Agent as the holder of such irrevocable power of attorney (fondé de pouvoir) upon becoming a Lender under this Credit Agreement as contemplated in Section 11.6(b)(A) and/or by receiving the benefits of the Collateral Documents.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of An Act Respecting the Special Powers of Legal Persons (Quebec), the Collateral Agent may acquire and be the holder of any debenture or bond.
The Borrower hereby acknowledges that such debenture or bond constitutes a title of indebtedness, as such term is used in Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec, as amended.
11.22       PATRIOT Act Notice.
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Credit Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, such Lender and the Administrative Agent are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Credit Parties, which information includes the name and address of the Credit Parties and other information that will allow such Lender and the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to identify the Credit Parties in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.
(a)  This Credit Agreement is an amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement and does not constitute a novation of the Existing Credit Agreement.
All “Obligations” under the Existing Credit Agreement (to the extent not paid on or prior to the Effective Date), and all security interests, Liens, and collateral
160
assignments granted to the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) or the Collateral Agent (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) under the Existing Credit Agreement or any of the other “Credit Documents” defined therein, hereby are renewed and continued in full force and effect, and hereafter shall be governed by this Credit Agreement or, to the extent appropriate, such other Credit Document as further amended or modified from time to time.
All existing “Credit Documents” previously executed in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, except to the extent such agreement is amended, restated or replaced in connection with this Credit Agreement, and any and all references therein to the Existing Credit Agreement (regardless of terminology) shall refer to and mean this Credit Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Credit Agreement Parties acknowledge and agree that any and all obligations of BofA, DBTCA and the other lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement (by virtue of the Bank Assignment Agreement or otherwise) are governed by the terms of this Credit Agreement (as an amendment and restatement in its entirety of the Existing Credit Agreement).
12.1         The Holdings Secured Guaranty.
In order to induce the Agents, each Issuing Lender and the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and to extend credit hereunder, and to induce the other Guaranteed Creditors to enter into Hedge Agreements, and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by Holdings from the proceeds of the Loans, the issuance of the Letters of Credit and the entering into of such Hedge Agreements, Holdings hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors as follows:  Holdings hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of any and all Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors.
If any or all of the Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors becomes due and payable hereunder, Holdings unconditionally promises to pay such Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by the Agents and the other Guaranteed Creditors in collecting any of the Obligations.
This guaranty constitutes a guaranty of payment and not of collection, and applies to all Obligations of the Borrower arising in connection with this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, in each case, heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or not such Guaranteed Obligations are from
161
time to time reduced, or extinguished and thereafter increased or incurred, whether the Borrower may be liable individually or jointly with others, whether or not recovery upon such Guaranteed Obligations may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether or not such Guaranteed Obligations may be or hereafter become otherwise unenforceable.
Additionally, Holdings unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the occurrence in respect of the Borrower of any of the events specified in Section 9.1(e), and unconditionally and irrevocably promises to pay all such Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States.
12.3         Nature of Liability.
The liability of Holdings hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of any of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower whether executed by Holdings, any other guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of Holdings hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to any Guaranteed Creditor on the Guaranteed Obligations which such Guaranteed Creditors repay to the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and Holdings waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.
12.4         Independent Obligation.
The obligations of Holdings hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Holdings whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not any other guarantor or the Borrower be joined in any such action or actions.
Holdings waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof.
Any payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Borrower shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, operate to toll the statute of limitations as to Holdings.
12.5         Authorization.
Holdings authorizes each Guaranteed Creditor without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to:
162
12.7         Subordination.
Any obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter owing to Holdings are hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; provided that payment may be made by the Borrower on any such obligations owing to Holdings so long as the same is not prohibited by this Credit Agreement; and provided further, that if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such obligations of the Borrower to Holdings shall be collected, enforced and received by Holdings as trustee for the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of Holdings under the other provisions of this Holdings Secured Guaranty.
Prior to the transfer by Holdings of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any obligations of the Borrower to Holdings, Holdings shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination.
Holdings hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any claim or right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result
163
of this Holdings Secured Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full.
12.8         Waiver.
(a)  Holdings waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any such Guaranteed Creditor’s power whatsoever.
Holdings waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Subject to the terms of the Credit Documents, any of the Guaranteed Creditors may, at its or their election, foreclose on any security held by any Agent, any Issuing Lender, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy any of the Guaranteed Creditors may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Holdings hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid.
Holdings waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defense arising out of any such election by any of the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Holdings against the Borrower or any other party or any security.

(1)          L/Cs required where WSI has a deductible program because claims are first paid by the insurance carrier and then they seek reimbursement of the deductible from us.
Since they are out-of-pocket for a period of time, the L/C protects them.
(2)          Because WSI is self-insured for W/C in the state of Washington, the state requires that a bond be posted to secure any W/C claims we would be obligated to pay.
Midwest Employers posts that bond for us.
In turn Midwest Employers wants an L/C from us in the event we default on our W/C claim obligations and the bond is “called” by the State.

RECITALS:
(a)                                  the Obligor and the Collateral Agent have entered into an amended and restated security agreement dated as of March 26, 2002, amended and restated as of August 18, 2003 and amended and restated as of June 28, 2005, (as the same may be further amended and restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Security Agreement”), under which, among other things, in order to secure the payment of the Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement), the Obligor has granted a security interest to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors (as defined in the Security Agreement) in all of the right, title and interest of the Obligor in and into, inter alia, any and all accounts and in all moneys, securities, instruments and other investments deposited therein from time to time (collectively, herein called the “Collateral”); and
(b)                                 the Obligor desires that the Deposit Account Bank enter into this Agreement in order to provide for the rights of the parties under this Agreement with respect to its Deposit Accounts;
In consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and agreements contained herein, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
Section 1                                             Obligor’s Dealings with Deposit Accounts; Notice of Exclusive Control.
Accounts; provided, however, that the Obligor may not, and the Deposit Account Bank agrees that it shall not permit the Obligor to, without the Collateral Agent’s prior written consent, close any Deposit Account.
Section 2                                             Collateral Agent’s Right To Give Instructions As To Deposit Accounts.
(1)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any separate agreement that the Obligor may have with the Deposit Account Bank, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for purposes of this Agreement, at any time to give the Deposit Account Bank instructions as to the withdrawal or disposition of any funds from time to time credited to any Deposit Account, or as to any other matters relating to any Deposit Account or any other Collateral, without further consent from the Obligor.
The Obligor hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Deposit Account Bank, and the Deposit Account Bank hereby agrees, to comply with any such instructions from the Collateral Agent without any further consent from the Obligor.
The Deposit Account Bank shall be fully entitled to rely on, and shall comply with, such instructions from the Collateral Agent even if such instructions are contrary to any instructions or demands that the Obligor may give to the Deposit Account Bank.
In case of any conflict between instructions received by the Deposit Account Bank from the Collateral Agent and the Obligor, the instructions from the Collateral Agent shall prevail.
(2)                                  It is understood and agreed that the Deposit Account Bank’s duty to comply with instructions from the Collateral Agent regarding the Deposit Accounts is absolute, and the Deposit Account Bank shall be under no duty or obligation, nor shall it have the authority, to inquire or determine whether or not such instructions are in accordance with the Security Agreement or any other Credit Document (as defined in the Security Agreement), nor seek confirmation thereof from the Obligor or any other Person (as defined in the Security Agreement).
Section 3                                             Obligor’s Exculpation And Indemnification Of Depository Bank.
-2-
The Obligor hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Deposit Account Bank to follow instructions from the Collateral Agent regarding the Deposit Accounts even if the result of following such instructions from the Collateral Agent is that the Deposit Account Bank dishonours items presented for payment from any Deposit Account.
The Obligor further confirms that the Deposit Account Bank shall have no liability to the Obligor for wrongful dishonour of such items in following such instructions from the Collateral Agent.
The Deposit Account Bank shall have no duty to inquire or determine whether the Obligor’s obligations to the Collateral Agent are in default or whether the Collateral Agent is entitled, under any separate agreement between the Obligor and the Collateral Agent, to give any such instructions.
The Obligor further agrees to be responsible for the Deposit Account Bank’s customary charges and to indemnify the Deposit Account Bank from and to hold the Deposit Account Bank harmless against any loss, cost or expense that the Deposit Account Bank may sustain or incur in acting upon instructions which the Deposit Account Bank believes in good faith to be instructions from the Collateral Agent.
Section 4                                             Subordination of Security Interests; Deposit Account Bank’s Recourse to Deposit Accounts.
The Deposit Account Bank hereby subordinates any claims and security interests it may have against, or with respect to, any Deposit Account at any time established or maintained with it by the Obligor (including any amounts, investments, instruments or other Collateral from time to time on deposit therein) to the security interests of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Creditors) therein, and agrees that no amounts shall be charged by it to, or withheld or set-off or otherwise recouped by it from, any Deposit Account of the Obligor or any amounts, investments, instruments or other Collateral from time to time on deposit therein; provided that the Deposit Account Bank may, however, from time to time debit the Deposit Accounts for any of its customary charges in maintaining the Deposit Accounts or for reimbursement for the reversal of any provisional credits granted by the Deposit Account Bank to any Deposit Account, to the extent, in each case, that the Obligor has not separately paid or reimbursed the Deposit Account Bank therefor.
Section 5                                             Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Deposit Account Bank.
(1)   If the respective Deposit Account Bank is unwilling to agree to this paragraph, then the Collateral Agent may take the action described in Section 4.28 of the Security Agreement.
-3-

Unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this opinion letter have the respective meanings given to them in the Security Agreement (as defined below).
In our capacity as counsel to the Guarantor, we have examined executed copies of the following documents (the “Documents”):

616311198, which was filed by Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP against the Guarantor amending the name and capacity of the Administrative Agent to Collateral Agent.
For the purposes of the opinions expressed below, we have, without independent investigation or verification, assumed:
(a)                                  the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us as certified or true copies or as reproductions, including transmission by facsimile machines, and the authenticity of all of the originals of such copies;
(b)                                 that there have been no erroneous statements of fact made in any certificates of public officials and we have relied on the completeness and accuracy of the public records and the currency of the information contained therein as of the dates indicated therein, although such records are known on occasion to contain errors and to be otherwise incomplete;
(c)                                  that each of the Ontario Documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by and constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation of each party thereto other than the Guarantor, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms;
(d)                                 that none of the collateral described in any of the Documents constitutes consumer goods within the meaning of the PPSA;
(e)                                  that the U.S.
Pledge Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement under New York law (in accordance with which it is expressed to be governed), enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms and that the provisions of the U.S.
Pledge Agreement will be interpreted and understood under
-4-
the laws of New York to have the same meaning and content as they would have under the laws of the Province of Ontario;
(f)                                    that the Collateral Agent and the Guarantor have not agreed to postpone the time for attachment of any security interest created by the Security Agreement;
(g)                                 that the Collateral Agent and the Borrower have not agreed to postpone the time for attachment of any security interest created by the U.S.
Pledge Agreement;
(h)                                 that the Collateral Agent or a person on its behalf (other than the Borrower or the Borrower’s agent) is in possession of the Pledged Shares (as defined in paragraph 4 below) and holds the same as collateral under the U.S.
Pledge Agreement; and
(i)                                     that to the extent that any of the Documents are to be performed in any jurisdiction other than the Province of Ontario, such performance will not be illegal under the laws of such jurisdiction.
The opinions expressed below are also subject to the following limitations, qualifications and restrictions:
(a)                                  the enforceability of the Documents is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, winding-up, moratorium, and other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally;
(b)                                 the effect of general principles of equity and that equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunction, may be granted only in the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction;
(c)                                  the enforcement of any of the Documents may be limited by the fact that a judgment of a Canadian court may be awarded only in Canadian currency;
(d)                                 to the extent that any party to the Documents is liable to indemnify any other party pursuant to any of the Documents, the provisions relating to such indemnification may be unenforceable to the extent that a court decides that any payment required to be made thereunder would derogate from the court’s discretion in respect of the costs of and incidental to a proceeding or a step in a proceeding, or would be inconsistent with the court’s determination by whom and to what extent such costs shall be paid;
(e)                                  provisions contained in any of the Documents purporting to sever from the relevant Document any provision prohibited or unenforceable under applicable law without affecting the enforceability or validity of the remainder of such Document would be enforced only to the extent that a court determines that such
-5-
prohibited or unenforceable provision could be severed without impairing the interpretation and application of the remainder of such Document;
(f)                                    a court of competent jurisdiction may require a creditor to give a debtor a reasonable period of time to pay amounts stated to be payable on demand or on default, and may delay a creditor’s enforcement of its security in respect of such obligations;
(g)                                 the power of a court to grant relief from forfeiture or to stay proceedings before it and to stay executions and judgments;
(h)                                 any provisions contained in the Documents which purport to confer a unilateral and unfettered discretion on the Collateral Agent or its agents may be unenforceable to the extent that a court may require that such discretion be exercised reasonably and in good faith;
(i)                                     to the extent that any certificate or determination provided for in any of the Documents and expressed to be “conclusive” may be subject to challenge in a court on grounds of fraud, collusion, mistake on the face of the certificate, or mistake on the basis that the certificate differed in a material respect from the certificate contemplated in such provision and notwithstanding provisions in the Documents to the contrary, a court may permit the Guarantor to introduce evidence in proceedings with respect to the Documents for the purpose of proving that a determination, account or certificate of the Collateral Agent is incorrect;
(j)                                     the effectiveness of provisions in any Document purporting to make the  Guarantor responsible for any actions or omissions of the Collateral Agent, its agents or any receiver, manager or receiver/manager may be limited by law;
(k)                                  no opinion is expressed as to the enforceability of any provision in any Document to the extent it purports to exculpate the Collateral Agent and the Secured Creditors or any party claiming through or under any of them, or any receiver, agent or receiver/manager from liability in respect of acts or omissions which may be illegal, fraudulent or negligent or involve wilful misconduct;
(l)                                     the enforceability of provisions in the Documents by which the Guarantor purports to waive any legal or equitable defences or rights otherwise available to it or agrees not to challenge the validity or enforceability of remedies under the Documents may be limited by law to the extent that such waiver by, or agreement of, the Guarantor is not expressed with sufficient particularity or would otherwise be prohibited by Applicable Laws;
-6-
(m)                               no opinion is expressed as to the enforceability of any provision of any of the Documents which states that amendments, modifications or waivers of or with respect to such Document that are not in writing will not be effective;
(n)                                 a Document may not be enforceable to the extent the Document provides for the payment to or receipt by any person of interest in an amount or rate prohibited by section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada);
(o)                                 notwithstanding any provision contained in the Documents which provides that any receiver, manager or receiver/manager appointed thereunder shall for all purposes be deemed to be the agent of the Guarantor, in certain circumstances the receiver, manager or receiver/manager may be held by a court to be acting as an agent of the Collateral Agent and not the Guarantor;
(p)                                 no opinion is expressed with respect to any provision of the Guarantee which provides that the Guarantor will be liable as principal debtor or obligor, and not as guarantor or surety, in respect of any of the obligations guaranteed pursuant to the Guarantee;
(q)                                 no opinion is expressed as to the ranking or priority of any mortgage, charge, pledge, assignment or security interest granted pursuant to the Documents;
(r)                                    no opinion is expressed as to the creation, validity, enforceability or perfection of any mortgage, charge, pledge, assignment or security interest in, or as to the enforceability of, any Document in so far as it relates to any contractual rights which, by their terms, or any other property, which by its nature, cannot be the subject of such mortgage, charge, assignment or security interest, or cannot be the subject thereof without the consent, authorization or approval of third parties and such consent, authorization or approval has not been obtained;
(s)                                  no examination has been made for the purposes of the opinions expressed herein, and no opinion is expressed herein, with respect to the title to, or ownership or location of, any collateral owned or purported to be owned by the Guarantor or any other person;
(t)                                    an assignment of a debt or account will not be binding on the account debtor to the extent that such debt or account is paid or otherwise discharged before notice of the assignment is given to the account debtor, together with a direction to pay the same to the  Collateral Agent;
(u)                                 no opinion is expressed as to whether it may be necessary, in connection with the enforcement of any of the Documents, for the Collateral Agent, or any person proposing to acquire, own or operate all or any part of the collateral under such
-7-
documents, to obtain any licence, franchise, permit, consent, approval, registration or other authorization or exemption;
(V)                                 the rights of the Secured Creditors and the Collateral Agent to enforce the provisions of the Documents may be prejudiced by any release by the Secured Creditors or by the Collateral Agent of the obligations of the Guarantor, in whole or in part, under the Guarantee;
(w)                               we express no opinion as to whether the Security Agreement complies with Part VII of the Financial Administration Act (Canada) in respect of any assignment of Crown debts (as defined in such Act) and with your assent, we have not taken steps to provide the notices or obtain the acknowledgements provided for in Part VII of that Act, and our opinions in paragraphs 5, 7 and 9 below are expressly qualified by this qualification.
An assignment of Crown debts not complying with that Act is ineffective as between assignor and assignee and as against the Crown and therefore the Collateral Agent would not have a valid security interest in Crown debts unless such Act is complied with;
(x)                                   security interests in certain types of personal property such as copyrights, trademarks, patents and other forms of intellectual property, fixtures, ships, railways and railway cars and certain other types of property are or may be governed by or subject to federal or provincial laws other than the PPSA.
With your assent, we have not taken steps to register or arrange for the registration of, any of the Documents or notice thereof under the PPSA or any other Ontario or federal statute; in particular, we have not effected registrations under the Bank Act (Canada), the Patent Act (Canada), the Trade-marks Act (Canada), the Copyright Act (Canada), the Industrial Designs Act (Canada) the Integrated Circuit Topography Act (Canada) (or any other statute relating to intellectual property), the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act (Canada), the Canada Shipping Act, the Canada Transportation Act or the Railways Act (Ontario).
Our opinion in paragraph 9 below is expressly qualified by this qualification;
(y)                                 where any collateral subject to a security interest granted under the Security Agreement  includes fixtures or goods that may become fixtures or rights to payment under a lease, mortgage or charge of real property to which the PPSA applies, a notice in the prescribed form under the PPSA must be registered in the appropriate land registry or land titles office in order to preserve the priority of the security interest in relation to the rights of other persons with interests in the real property.
We have not taken steps to register such  notices, and our opinion in paragraph 10 below is expressly qualified by this qualification;
(z)                                   where any collateral subject to a security interest granted under the Security Agreement includes a motor vehicle classified as equipment of the Guarantor that is sold by the Guarantor out of the ordinary course of business, the buyer of such
-8-
motor vehicle will take it free and clear of the security interest created in the Security Agreement unless the vehicle identification number of the motor vehicle is set out in a financing statement duly registered under the PPSA in which the Collateral Agent is the secured party;
(aa)                            insofar as the Security Agreement constitutes a mortgage, charge, pledge, assignment or security interest of, upon or in any lease, agreement or other document or any rent, income or interest derived therefrom, the opinions below are subject to the qualification that the rights of  the Collateral Agent may be affected by the equities between the immediate parties thereto;
(bb)                          no opinion is expressed as to the creation, perfection or enforceability of a security interest in any collateral under the Security Agreement to the extent that such collateral is not identifiable or traceable;
(cc)                            the exercise of certain rights and remedies provided in the Documents may be affected by the provisions of the PPSA including, without limitation, sections 16, 17 and 39 and Part V of the PPSA to the extent that those rights and remedies are inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of the PPSA;
(dd)                          we have relied on the Certificate of Status and the Officer’s Certificate for the purpose of giving the opinion expressed in paragraph 1 below;
(ee)                            perfection of the security interest in the Pledged Shares (as defined below) by possession continues only so long as the Collateral Agent or a person on its behalf other than the Borrower or the Borrower’s agent continues to hold the same as collateral; and
(ff)                                while registration of a financing statement pursuant to the PPSA may perfect a security interest in the trade-marks, patents, copyrights and industrial designs of the Guarantor, the security interest therein may be subject to the interest of a third party who registers a transfer or assignment of a trade-mark, patent, copyright or industrial design of the Guarantor, or of an interest therein, pursuant to the applicable federal statute governing such property, unless the interest of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Creditors has been registered by way of a transfer or assignment pursuant to such statute prior to the registration made by such third party.
The opinions expressed below are limited to the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, in each case, in force as at the date hereof (collectively, “Applicable Laws”).
In particular, without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, no opinion is expressed with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction to the extent such laws may govern the validity, perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection or enforcement of the security interests created by any Documents as a result of
-9-
the application of Ontario conflict of laws rules, including, without limitation, the provisions of the PPSA.
In addition, we express no opinion on whether, pursuant to those conflicts of laws rules, Ontario laws would govern the validity, perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection or enforcement of those security interests, or any other issues relating to the U.S.
Pledge Agreement or the security interest provided for therein.
We further express no opinion in respect of any provisions of New York law (or any other laws other than Applicable Laws) that are referred to in the U.S.
Pledge Agreement.
Based and relying upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
1.
The Guarantor is incorporated and existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario.
2.
The Guarantor has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver each of the Ontario Documents and to perform its obligations under the Ontario Documents.
3.
The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of each of the Ontario Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Guarantor.
4.
The authorized capital of the Guarantor consists of an unlimited number of common shares, of which 1000 common shares have been issued and are outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable.
The said 1000 issued and outstanding common shares of the Guarantor (the “Pledged Shares”) are registered on the share register of the Guarantor in the name of the Borrower.
5.
The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of the Ontario Documents and the performance by it of its obligations thereunder, and the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the U.S.
Pledge Agreement and the performance by it of its obligations thereunder (including the transfer of the Pledged Shares to the Collateral Agent), do not contravene, result in a breach of or constitute a default under (i) the articles or by-laws of the Guarantor, (ii) the USA, or (iii) any Applicable Laws.
6.
Each Ontario Document has been duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor by the Collateral Agent and (to the extent applicable) the Secured Creditors, in accordance with its respective terms.
7.
The Security Agreement creates in favour of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors a security interest under the PPSA in all right, title and interest of the Guarantor in and to the collateral to which the PPSA is applicable referred to therein, in which the Guarantor now has rights, and is sufficient to
-10-
create a security interest in any collateral to which the PPSA is applicable referred to therein, in which the Guarantor hereafter acquires rights, when those rights are acquired by the Guarantor, in each case to secure payment and performance of the obligations referred to therein.
8.
The U.S.
Pledge Agreement creates in favour of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors (as defined therein), a security interest under the PPSA in all right, title and interest of the Borrower in and to the collateral referred to therein to which the PPSA is applicable in which the Borrower now has rights, and is sufficient to create a security interest in any collateral to which the PPSA is applicable referred to therein, in which the Borrower hereafter acquires rights, when those rights are acquired by the Borrower to secure payment and performance of the obligations referred to therein, and the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Pledged Shares has been perfected by possession.
9.
No authorization, consent, approval, or licence of, or other action by, or filing with, any Ontario or Canadian federal government or regulatory authority or agency is required by Applicable Laws to be obtained by the Guarantor or the Borrower at this time in connection with the execution and delivery by the Guarantor of the Ontario Documents or by the Borrower of the U.S.
Pledge Agreement and the performance of their respective obligations thereunder.
10.
All consents, approvals or authorizations required under the articles or by-laws of the Guarantor, the USA and Applicable Laws and all necessary corporate action by the Guarantor has been obtained or taken to authorize the transfer on the share register of the Guarantor of the Pledged Shares to the Collateral Agent or its nominee, and a subsequent transfer on the share register of the Guarantor by the Collateral Agent or its nominee, to any other party the Collateral Agent may determine in connection with any sale or other proceedings in respect of the Pledged Shares pursuant to the U.S.
Pledge Agreement.

We wish to draw to your attention to the fact that a security interest perfected by registration under the PPSA will remain effective only for the registration period specified (or deemed to be specified) in a financing statement filed in respect thereof under the PPSA.
The registration period of a security interest may be extended by successive registrations under the PPSA of an appropriate form of financing change statement, in each case effected prior to the expiry of the then current registration.
In addition, the PPSA requires that (subject to certain exceptions) if there is a change in the name or address of the debtor (as defined in the PPSA) or a transfer of the debtor’s interest in the collateral subject to a security interest, timely registration must be effected of a financing change statement in the prescribed form.
Failure to comply with any of the foregoing requirements will result in a security interest becoming unperfected under the PPSA.
We assume no responsibility for maintaining or updating any such filing(s).
In addition, failure to maintain registrations and other notices against or in respect of title to the real property of the Guarantor in the appropriate land registry office and in such other offices and with such other agencies as may from time to time be provided for by Applicable Laws or otherwise may adversely affect the security interests granted under the Ontario Documents.
We assume no responsibility for making, maintaining or updating any such registrations and/or notices.
The opinions and advice expressed herein are provided solely for the benefit of the addressees in connection with the Documents and may not be used, relied upon or referred to by the addressees for any other purpose or by any other person for any purpose whatsoever, in each case, without our prior written consent; provided that any permitted assignee or participant of the rights of the Secured Creditors under the Credit Documents and the Interest Rate Agreements and any future agent of the Secured Creditors pursuant to the Credit Agreement may rely upon such opinions and advice as if this letter were addressed to them, and further provided that Ogilvy Renault S.E.N.C.R.L., S.R.L.

Unless and until the Collateral Agent requests the Assignors to alter the secured party to directly name the Collateral Agent, such certificates may continue to reflect DBTCA or BTCC, as the case may be, as secured party so long as DBTCA or BTCC, as the case may be, continues to act as a sub-collateral agent of the Collateral Agent hereunder.
(c)                                  With respect to all Units acquired by any Assignor on or after the Amendment and Restatement Effective Date, or where the interest of the Collateral Agent (or a sub-collateral agent) is to be noted thereon on or after the Amendment and Restatement Effective Date, the Assignor shall cause the Collateral Agent to be directly named as the secured party; provided that if for any reason DBTCA or BTCC is named as the secured party it shall act as sub-collateral agent of the Collateral Agent with respect thereto as provided above in this Section 10.15.

(b)                                 Any Person which becomes an Assignor after the date of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.14 shall also become a party to the Custodian Agreement, as a “Company”, in accordance with the relevant provisions thereof.
10.17.
Acknowledgements Regarding Security Bond Obligations.
For greater certainty, and without limiting the powers of the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents, the Borrower hereby acknowledges that the Collateral Agent shall, for purposes of holding any security interest granted by any Credit Party in any of its property or assets pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec to secure obligations of such Credit Party under any debenture or bond (any such obligations, “Security Bond Obligations”), be the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (fondé de pouvoir) (within the meaning of the Civil Code of Quebec, as amended) for each of the First Lien Creditors and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (on behalf of the Second Lien Creditors) and in particular for all present and future holders of any debenture or bond (the First Lien Creditors and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (on behalf of the Second Lien Creditors) and any such holders, collectively, the “Secured Creditor Grantors”).
In accepting the benefits afforded to it hereunder, each Secured Creditor Grantor hereby constitutes, to the extent necessary, the Collateral Agent as the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (fondé de pouvoir) (within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec, as amended) in order to hold security granted by any Credit Party in the Province of Quebec to secure Security Bond Obligations.
Each assignee of any Secured Creditor Grantor shall be deemed to have confirmed and ratified the constitution of the Collateral Agent as the holder of such irrevocable power of attorney (fondé de pouvoir) upon becoming a Lender under the Credit Agreement as contemplated in Section 11.6(b)(A) thereof or becoming a Senior Secured Noteholder in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as the case may be, and/or by receiving the benefits of the Collateral Documents.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of An Act Respecting the Special Powers of Legal Persons (Quebec), the Collateral Agent may acquire and be the holder of any debenture or bond.
The Borrower hereby acknowledges that such debenture or bond constitutes a title of indebtedness, as such term is used in Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec, as amended.

Form of Control Agreement Regarding Deposit Accounts
W I T N E S S E T H :
WHEREAS, the Assignor, various other Assignors and the Collateral Agent have entered into an Amended and Restated Security Agreement, dated as of March 26, 2002, amended and restated as of August 18, 2003 and amended and restated as of June 28, 2005 (as further amended, amended and restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Security Agreement”), under which, among other things, in order to secure the payment of the Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement), the Assignor has granted a security interest to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors (as defined in the Security Agreement) in all of the right, title and interest of the Assignor in and into any and all deposit accounts (as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC) and in all moneys, securities, instruments and other investments deposited therein from time to time (collectively, herein called the “Collateral”); and
WHEREAS, the Assignor desires that the Deposit Account Bank enter into this Agreement in order to establish “control” (as defined in Section 9-104 of the UCC) in each Deposit Account at any time or from time to time maintained with the Deposit Account Bank, and to provide for the rights of the parties under this Agreement with respect to such Deposit Accounts;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and agreements contained herein, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1.
Assignor’s Dealings with Deposit Accounts; Notice of Exclusive Control.
Annex F
Page 2
Deposit Accounts, which notice states that it is a “Notice of Exclusive Control” (a “Notice of Exclusive Control”), only the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to withdraw funds from the Deposit Accounts, to give any instructions in respect of the Deposit Accounts and any funds held therein or credited thereto or otherwise to deal with the Deposit Accounts.
2.
(a)  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any separate agreement that the Assignor may have with the Deposit Account Bank, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for purposes of this Agreement, at any time to give the Deposit Account Bank instructions as to the withdrawal or disposition of any funds from time to time credited to any Deposit Account, or as to any other matters relating to any Deposit Account or any other Collateral, without further consent from the Assignor.
The Assignor hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Deposit Account Bank, and the Deposit Account Bank hereby agrees, to comply with any such instructions from the Collateral Agent without any further consent from the Assignor.
The Deposit Account Bank shall be fully entitled to rely on, and shall comply with, such instructions from the Collateral Agent even if such instructions are contrary to any instructions or demands that the Assignor may give to the Deposit Account Bank.
In case of any conflict between instructions received by the Deposit Account Bank from the Collateral Agent and the Assignor, the instructions from the Collateral Agent shall prevail.
(b)                                 It is understood and agreed that the Deposit Account Bank’s duty to comply with instructions from the Collateral Agent regarding the Deposit Accounts is absolute, and the Deposit Account Bank shall be under no duty or obligation, nor shall it have the authority, to inquire or determine whether or not such instructions are in accordance with the Security Agreement or any other Credit Document (as defined in the Security Agreement), nor seek confirmation thereof from the Assignor or any other Person.
3.
Assignor’s Exculpation and Indemnification of Depository Bank.
The Assignor hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Deposit Account Bank to follow instructions from the Collateral Agent regarding the Deposit Accounts even if the result of following such instructions from the Collateral Agent is that the Deposit Account Bank dishonors items presented for payment from any Deposit Account.
The Assignor further confirms that the Deposit Account Bank shall have no liability to the Assignor for wrongful dishonor of such items in following such instructions from the Collateral Agent.
The Deposit Account Bank shall have no duty to inquire or determine whether the Assignor’s obligations to the Collateral Agent are in default or whether the Collateral Agent is entitled, under any separate agreement between the Assignor and the Collateral Agent, to give any such instructions.
The Assignor further agrees to be responsible for the Deposit Account Bank’s customary charges and to indemnify the Deposit Account Bank from and to hold the Deposit Account Bank harmless against any loss, cost or expense that the Deposit Account Bank may sustain or incur in acting upon instructions which the Deposit Account Bank believes in good faith to be instructions from the Collateral Agent.
4.
Subordination of Security Interests; Deposit Account Bank’s Recourse to Deposit Accounts.
The Deposit Account Bank hereby subordinates any claims and security
Annex F
Page 3
interests it may have against, or with respect to, any Deposit Account at any time established or maintained with it by the Assignor (including any amounts, investments, instruments or other Collateral from time to time on deposit therein) to the security interests of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Creditors) therein, and agrees that no amounts shall be charged by it to, or withheld or set-off or otherwise recouped by it from, any Deposit Account of the Assignor or any amounts, investments, instruments or other Collateral from time to time on deposit therein; provided that the Deposit Account Bank may, however, from time to time debit the Deposit Accounts for any of its customary charges in maintaining the Deposit Accounts or for reimbursement for the reversal of any provisional credits granted by the Deposit Account Bank to any Deposit Account, to the extent, in each case, that the Assignor has not separately paid or reimbursed the Deposit Account Bank therefor.1
5.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Deposit Account Bank.
The Deposit Account Bank represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent that:
(a)                                  The Deposit Account Bank constitutes a “bank” (as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC), that the jurisdiction (determined in accordance with Section 9-304 of the UCC) of the Deposit Account Bank for purposes of each Deposit Account maintained by the Assignor with the Deposit Account Bank shall be one or more States within the United States.
(b)                                 The Deposit Account Bank shall not permit any Assignor to establish any demand, time, savings, passbook or other account with it which it does not constitute a Deposit Account (as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC).
(c)                                  The account agreements between the Deposit Account Bank and the Assignor relating to the establishment and general operation of the Deposit Accounts provide, whether specifically or generally, that the laws of ____________2 govern secured transactions relating to the Deposit Accounts and that the Deposit Account Bank’s “jurisdiction” for purposes of Section 9-304 of the UCC in respect of the Deposit Accounts is _____________.3  The Deposit Account Bank will not, without the Collateral Agent’s prior written consent, amend any such account agreement so that the Deposit Account Bank’s jurisdiction for purposes of Section 9-304 of the UCC is other than a jurisdiction permitted pursuant to preceding clause (a).
All account agreements in respect
1                    If the respective Deposit Account Bank is unwilling to agree to this paragraph, then the Collateral Agent may take the action described in Section 3.14 of the Security Agreement.
If the Deposit Account Bank does not agree to subordinations, its security interests in the Deposit Accounts maintained with it will have priority over the Collateral Agent’s security interests therein under Section 9-327 of Revised Article 9.
2                    Inserted jurisdiction(s) must be consistent with requirements of preceding clause (a).
3                    See footnote 2.
Annex F
Page 4
(d)                                 The Deposit Account Bank has not entered and will not enter, into any agreement with any other Person by which the Deposit Account Bank is obligated to comply with instructions from such other Person as to the disposition of funds from any Deposit Account or other dealings with any Deposit Account or other of the Collateral.
(e)                                  On the date hereof the Deposit Account Bank maintains no Deposit Accounts for the Assignor other than the Deposit Accounts specifically identified in Annex A hereto.
(f)                                    Any items or funds received by the Deposit Account Bank for the Assignor’s account will be credited to said Deposit Accounts specified in paragraph (e) above or to any other Deposit Accounts hereafter established by the Deposit Account Bank for the Assignor in accordance with this Agreement.

ANNEX N
to
1.
Appointment.
The Secured Creditors, by their acceptance of the benefits of the Security Agreement to which this Annex N is attached, the Pledge Agreement, the Mortgages and the other Collateral Documents, hereby irrevocably designate BofA (as well as any sub-collateral agent or co-collateral agent designated by BofA as provided in Section 10.11 of the Credit Agreement) (and, in each case, any successor Collateral Agent) to act as specified herein and therein.
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein and defined in (or incorporated by reference in) the Security Agreement, are used herein as therein defined.
Each Secured Creditor hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Obligation by the acceptance of such Obligation and by the acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral Documents shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Collateral Documents and any instruments and agreements referred to therein and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Collateral Agent by the terms thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Collateral Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder or thereunder by or through its authorized agents, sub-agents or employees.
2.
Nature of Duties.
(a)  The Collateral Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein or in the Collateral Documents.
The duties of the Collateral Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Collateral Agent shall not have by reason of the Collateral Documents or any other Secured Debt Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Secured Creditor; and nothing in the Collateral Documents or in any other Secured Debt Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Collateral Agent any obligations in respect of the Collateral Documents except as expressly set forth herein and therein.
(b)  The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for perfecting (or maintaining the perfection of) or insuring the Collateral (which, for purposes of this Annex N, shall mean all collateral under all of the Collateral Documents) or for the payment of taxes, charges or assessments or discharging of Liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral.
(c)  The Collateral Agent shall not be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance by any Assignor of any of the covenants or agreements contained in the Collateral Documents or in any other Secured Debt Agreement.
(d)  The Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation or duty to take any action under, or with respect to, any of the Collateral Documents if taking such action (i) would subject the Collateral Agent to a tax in any jurisdiction where it is not then subject to such tax or (ii) would require the Collateral Agent to qualify to do business, or obtain any license, in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or licensed or (iii) would subject the Collateral Agent to in personam jurisdiction in any locations where it is not then so subject.
Annex N
Page 2
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Annex N or any provision of any Collateral Document, neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, affiliates or agents shall be personally liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with, or pursuant to, this Annex N or any of the Collateral Documents except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).
3.
Lack of Reliance on the Collateral Agent.
Independently and without reliance upon the Collateral Agent, each Secured Creditor, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Assignor and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making and the continuance of the Obligations and the taking or not taking of any action in connection therewith, and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Assignor and its Subsidiaries, and the Collateral Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Secured Creditor with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the extension of any Obligations or the purchase of any Obligations or at any time or times thereafter.
The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever to any Secured Creditor for the correctness of any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of any of the Collateral Documents or the security interests granted thereunder or the financial condition of any Assignor or any Subsidiary of any Assignor or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of any of the Collateral Documents, or the financial condition of any Assignor or any Subsidiary of any Assignor, or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.
The Collateral Agent makes no representations as to the value, condition or perfection of the Collateral or any part thereof, or as to the title of any Assignor thereto or as to the security afforded by any of the Collateral Documents.
4.
Certain Rights of the Collateral Agent.
(a)  No Secured Creditor shall have  (i) any right to individually seek to enforce any Collateral Document or to realize upon the security to be granted thereby or (ii) any right to cause the Collateral Agent to take any action with respect to the Collateral, with only the Collateral Agent having the right to take any such action at the direction of the Required Secured Creditors.
If the Collateral Agent shall request instructions from the Required Secured Creditors with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with any of the Collateral Documents, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until it shall have received instructions from the Required Secured Creditors and to the extent requested, appropriate indemnification in respect of actions to be taken, and the Collateral Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.
Without limiting the foregoing, no Secured Creditor shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Collateral Agent as a result of the Collateral Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the Required Secured Creditors.
(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Collateral Agent is authorized, but not obligated, (i) to take any action reasonably required to perfect or
Annex N
Page 3
continue the perfection of the Liens on the Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Creditors and (ii) when instructions from the Required Secured Creditors have been requested by the Collateral Agent but have not yet been received, to take any action which the Collateral Agent, in good faith, believes to be desirable or reasonably required to promote and protect the interests of the Secured Creditors in the Collateral.
(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the Collateral Documents, the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that (i) exposes, or in the good faith judgment of the Collateral Agent may expose, the Collateral Agent or its officers, directors, affiliates, agents or employees to personal liability, unless the Collateral Agent shall be adequately indemnified as provided herein, or (ii) is, or in the good faith judgment of the Collateral Agent may be, contrary to any of the Collateral Documents, any other Secured Debt Agreement or applicable law.
5.
Reliance.
The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by the proper Person or entity, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining hereto or to any of the other Collateral Documents and its duties thereunder and hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.
6.
Indemnification.
To the extent the Collateral Agent is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Assignors, the Secured Creditors (other than the Second Lien Creditors) will reimburse and indemnify the Collateral Agent, in proportion to their respective outstanding principal amounts of Obligations (including, for this purpose, any unpaid First Lien Primary Obligations and any unpaid First Lien Secondary Obligations, in respect of Letters of Credit, as outstanding principal) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Collateral Agent in performing its duties hereunder or under any Collateral Document, or in any way relating to or arising out of its actions as Collateral Agent in respect of the Collateral Documents except to the extent resulting from the Collateral Agent’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).
The indemnities set forth in this Section 6 shall survive the repayment of all Obligations, with the respective indemnification at such time to be based upon the outstanding principal amounts (determined as described above) of Obligations at the time of the respective occurrence upon which the claim against the Collateral Agent is based or, if same is not reasonably determinable, based upon the outstanding principal amounts (determined as described above) of Obligations as in effect immediately prior to the termination of the Collateral Documents.
The indemnities set forth in this Section 6 are in addition to any indemnities provided by the Lenders to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement, with the effect being that the Lenders shall be responsible for indemnifying the Collateral Agent to the extent the Collateral Agent does not receive payments pursuant to this Section 6 from the Secured Creditors as provided above (although in such event, and upon the payment in full of all such amounts owing to the Collateral Agent by the Lenders, the Lenders shall be subrogated to the rights of the Collateral Agent to receive payment from the respective other Secured Creditors).
Annex N
Page 4
7.
The Collateral Agent in its Individual Capacity.
With respect to its obligations as a Secured Creditor under any Secured Debt Agreement to which the Collateral Agent is a party, and to act as agent under one or more of such Secured Debt Agreements, the Collateral Agent shall have the rights and powers specified herein for a Secured Creditor, and may exercise the same rights and powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the terms “Secured Creditors,” “Lenders,” “Required Lenders,” “Interest Rate Creditors,” “holders of Obligations” or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity.
The Collateral Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, investment banking, trust or other business with any Assignor or any affiliate or Subsidiary of any Assignor as if it were not performing the duties specified herein or in the other Secured Debt Agreements, and may accept fees and other consideration from the Assignors for services in connection with the Secured Debt Agreements and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Secured Creditors.
8.
Such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (b) or (c) below or as otherwise provided in clause (d) below.

RECITALS:
(b)                                 the Obligor and the Collateral Agent have entered into an amended and restated security agreement dated as of March 26, 2002, amended and restated as of August 18, 2003 and amended and restated as of June 28, 2005, (as the same may be further amended and restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Security Agreement”), under which, among other things, in order to secure the payment of the Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement), the Obligor has granted a security interest to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors (as defined in the Security Agreement) in all of the right, title and interest of the Obligor in and into, inter alia, any and all accounts and in all moneys, securities, instruments and other investments deposited therein from time to time (collectively, herein called the “Collateral”); and
(c)                                  the Obligor desires that the Deposit Account Bank enter into this Agreement in order to provide for the rights of the parties under this Agreement with respect to its Deposit Accounts;
In consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and agreements contained herein, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
Section 1                                             Obligor’s Dealings with Deposit Accounts; Notice of Exclusive Control.
Section 2                                             Collateral Agent’s Right To Give Instructions As To Deposit Accounts.
(1)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any separate agreement that the Obligor may have with the Deposit Account Bank, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for purposes of this Agreement, at any time to give the Deposit Account Bank instructions as to the withdrawal or disposition of any funds from time to time credited to any Deposit Account, or as to any other matters relating to any Deposit Account or any other Collateral, without further consent from the Obligor.
The Obligor hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Deposit Account Bank, and the Deposit Account Bank hereby agrees, to comply with any such instructions from the Collateral Agent without any further consent from the Obligor.
The Deposit Account Bank shall be fully entitled to rely on, and shall comply with, such instructions from the Collateral Agent even if such instructions are contrary to any instructions or demands that the Obligor may give to the Deposit Account Bank.
In case of any conflict between instructions received by the Deposit Account Bank from the Collateral Agent and the Obligor, the instructions from the Collateral Agent shall prevail.
(2)                                  It is understood and agreed that the Deposit Account Bank’s duty to comply with instructions from the Collateral Agent regarding the Deposit Accounts is absolute, and the Deposit Account Bank shall be under no duty or obligation, nor shall it have the authority, to inquire or determine whether or not such instructions are in accordance with the Security Agreement or any other Credit Document (as defined in the Security Agreement), nor seek confirmation thereof from the Obligor or any other Person (as defined in the Security Agreement).
Section 3                                             Obligor’s Exculpation And Indemnification Of Depository Bank.
The Obligor hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Deposit Account Bank to follow instructions from the Collateral Agent regarding the Deposit Accounts even if the result of following such instructions from the Collateral Agent
-2-
is that the Deposit Account Bank dishonours items presented for payment from any Deposit Account.
The Obligor further confirms that the Deposit Account Bank shall have no liability to the Obligor for wrongful dishonour of such items in following such instructions from the Collateral Agent.
The Deposit Account Bank shall have no duty to inquire or determine whether the Obligor’s obligations to the Collateral Agent are in default or whether the Collateral Agent is entitled, under any separate agreement between the Obligor and the Collateral Agent, to give any such instructions.
The Obligor further agrees to be responsible for the Deposit Account Bank’s customary charges and to indemnify the Deposit Account Bank from and to hold the Deposit Account Bank harmless against any loss, cost or expense that the Deposit Account Bank may sustain or incur in acting upon instructions which the Deposit Account Bank believes in good faith to be instructions from the Collateral Agent.
Section 4                                             Subordination of Security Interests; Deposit Account Bank’s Recourse to Deposit Accounts.
The Deposit Account Bank hereby subordinates any claims and security interests it may have against, or with respect to, any Deposit Account at any time established or maintained with it by the Obligor (including any amounts, investments, instruments or other Collateral from time to time on deposit therein) to the security interests of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Creditors) therein, and agrees that no amounts shall be charged by it to, or withheld or set-off or otherwise recouped by it from, any Deposit Account of the Obligor or any amounts, investments, instruments or other Collateral from time to time on deposit therein; provided that the Deposit Account Bank may, however, from time to time debit the Deposit Accounts for any of its customary charges in maintaining the Deposit Accounts or for reimbursement for the reversal of any provisional credits granted by the Deposit Account Bank to any Deposit Account, to the extent, in each case, that the Obligor has not separately paid or reimbursed the Deposit Account Bank therefor.
Section 5                                             Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Deposit Account Bank.
The Deposit Account Bank represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent that:
(1)   If the respective Deposit Account Bank is unwilling to agree to this paragraph, then the Collateral Agent may take the action described in Section 4.28 of the Security Agreement.
-3-
(b)                                 The Deposit Account Bank has not entered and will not enter, into any agreement with any other Person by which the Deposit Account Bank is obligated to comply with instructions from such other Person as to the disposition of funds from any Deposit Account or other dealings with any Deposit Account or other of the Collateral.
(c)                                  On the date hereof the Deposit Account Bank maintains no Deposit Accounts for the Obligor other than the Deposit Accounts specifically identified in Annex A hereto.
(d)                                 Any items or funds received by the Deposit Account Bank for the Obligor’s account will be credited to said Deposit Accounts specified in paragraph (c) above or to any other Deposit Accounts hereafter established by the Deposit Account Bank for the Obligor in accordance with this Agreement.
Section 6               Deposit Account Statements and Information.
Section 7                                             Conflicting Agreements.

FORM OF SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE
To the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders
party to the Credit Agreement referred to below:
I, the undersigned, the Chief Financial Officer of Williams Scotsman, Inc. (the “Company”) a Maryland corporation, in that capacity only and not in my individual capacity (and without personal liability), do hereby certify as of the date hereof, and based upon facts and circumstances as they exist as of the date hereof (and disclaiming any responsibility for changes in such facts and circumstances after the date hereof), that:
1.
Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Certificate shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.
2.
For purposes of this Certificate, the terms below shall have the following definitions:
(a)           “Fair Value”
The amount at which the assets, in their entirety, of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as whole, would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under any compulsion to act.
(b)                                 “Present Fair Salable Value”
The amount that could be obtained by an independent willing seller from an independent willing buyer if the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole are sold with reasonable promptness in an arm’s-length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises insofar as such conditions can be reasonably evaluated.
(c)           “Stated Liabilities”
The recorded liabilities (as of the Effective Date after giving effect to the Credit Events to occur on such date) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
Exhibit I
Page 2
taken as a whole as of the date hereof, determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.
(d)           “Identified Contingent Liabilities”
The estimated and probable amount of liabilities reasonably likely to result from pending litigation, asserted claims and assessments, guaranties, uninsured risks and other currently known contingent liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
(e)                                  “Will be able to pay its Stated Liabilities, including Identified Contingent Liabilities, as they mature”
For the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole will have sufficient assets and cash flow to pay or refinance its Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as those liabilities mature or otherwise become payable.
(f)                                    “Does not have Unreasonably Small Capital”
For the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole after giving effect to all Indebtedness (including the Loans) being incurred or assumed and Liens created by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection therewith, is a going concern and has sufficient capital to ensure that it will continue to be a going concern for such period and to remain a going concern.
3.
For purposes of this Certificate, I, or officers of the Company under my direction and supervision, have performed the following procedures as of and for the periods set forth below.
(a)                                  I have reviewed the financial statements (including the unaudited consolidated financial statements) referred to in Section 6.10 of the Credit Agreement.
(b)                                 I have made inquiries of certain officials of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding (i) the existence and amount of Identified Contingent Liabilities associated with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) whether the unaudited consolidated financial statements referred to in para­graph (a) above are in conformity with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with that of the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2004.
(c)                                  I have knowledge of and have reviewed to my satisfaction the Credit Documents and the respective Annexes and Exhibits thereto.
Exhibit I
Page 3
(d)                                 With respect to Identified Contingent Liabilities, I:
1.                                       inquired of certain officials of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have responsibility for legal, financial and accounting matters as to the existence and estimated liability with respect to all Identified Contingent Liabilities known to them; and
2.                                       confirmed with officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries that, to the best of such officers’ knowledge, (i) all appropriate items were included in Stated Liabilities or Identified Contingent Liabilities made known to me in the course of my inquiry and that (ii) the amounts relating thereto were the estimable and probable amount of liability reasonably likely to result therefrom as of the date hereof.
(e)                                  I have made inquiries of certain officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have responsibility for financial reporting and accounting matters regarding whether they were aware of any events or conditions that, as of the date hereof, would cause the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, to (i) have assets with a Fair Value or Present Fair Salable Value that are less than the sum of Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities; (ii) have Unreasonably Small Capital; or (iii) not be able to pay or refinance their respective Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as they mature or otherwise become payable.
4.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, I hereby certify on behalf of the Company and not in my individual capacity that, it is my belief that as of the date hereof, and after giving effect to the amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement and the transactions in connection therewith, (i) the Fair Value and Present Fair Salable Value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole exceed their Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities; (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole do not have Unreasonably Small Capital; and (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole will be able to pay or refinance their Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as they mature or otherwise become payable.

This Guarantee shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall enure to the benefit of the Secured Creditors, the Collateral Agent and their respective successors and assigns.
All rights of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Creditors shall be assignable and in any action brought by an assignee to enforce any such right, the Guarantor shall not assert against the assignee any claim or defence which the Guarantor now has or hereafter may have against the Collateral Agent or any of the Secured Creditors.
If any provision of this Guarantee is deemed by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or void, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
provided, that any change, waiver, modification or variance affecting the rights and benefits of a single Class (as defined below) of Secured Creditors (and not all Secured Creditors in a like or similar manner) shall require the written consent of the Requisite Creditors (as defined below) of such Class of Secured Creditors (it being understood that the release of any guarantor hereunder shall not constitute a change, waiver, discharge or termination affecting any guarantor other than the guarantor so added or released).
For the purpose of this Guarantee the term “Class” means each class of Secured Creditors, i.e., whether (x) the Bank Creditors as holders of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Obligations or (y) the Interest Rate Creditors as the holders of the Interest Rate Obligations.
For the purpose of this Guarantee, the term “Requisite Creditors” of any Class means each of (x) with respect to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Obligations, the Required Lenders, or if required by Section 11.10 of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, all of the Lenders and (y) with respect to the Interest Rate Obligations, the holders of at least a majority of all obligations outstanding from time to time under the Interest Rate Agreements.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Guarantee, the Secured Creditors and the Collateral Agent agree that this Guarantee may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, in each case acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or, after the date on which all Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Obligations have been paid in full, the holders of at least a majority of the Interest Rate Obligations) and that no other Secured Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guarantee or to realize upon the security to be granted hereby, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent or the holders of at least a majority of the Interest Rate Obligations, as the case may be, for the benefit of the Secured Creditors upon the terms of this Guarantee and the other Credit Documents.
The Secured Creditors further agree that this Guarantee may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee, or shareholder (except to the extent such shareholder is a Credit Party) of the Guarantor.
It is understood that the agreement in this Section 5.6 is among and solely for the benefit of the Lenders and that if the Required Lenders so agree (without requiring the consent of the Guarantor), the Guarantee may be directly enforced by any Secured Creditor.
This Guarantee shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Guarantor has caused this Guarantee to be executed by its duly authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.
