The Lockbox Service involves processing Checks that are received at a Lockbox Address.
With this Service, each Company instructs its customers to mail checks it wants to have processed under the Service to the Lockbox Address.
Bank picks up mail at the Lockbox Address according to its mail pick-up schedule.
Bank will have unrestricted and exclusive access to the mail directed to the Lockbox Address.
Bank will provide each Company with the Lockbox Service for a Lockbox Address when such Company has completed and Bank has received Bank’s then current set-up documents for the Lockbox Address.
If Bank receives any mail containing a Company’s lockbox number at Bank’s lockbox operations location (instead of the Lockbox Address), Bank may handle the mail as if it had been received at the Lockbox Address.
Bank will handle Checks received at the Lockbox Address according to the applicable deposit account agreement, as if the Checks were delivered by one of the Companies to Bank for deposit to the Account, except as modified by these Terms and Conditions.
Bank will open the envelopes picked up from the Lockbox Address and remove the contents.
Unless the Companies and Bank agree to another processing procedure, Bank will reclear a Check once which has been returned and marked “Refer to Maker,” “Not Sufficient Funds” or “Uncollected Funds.”  If the Check is returned for any other reason or if the Check is returned a second time, Bank will debit the Account and return the Check to the applicable Company.
Each Company agrees that Bank will not send a returned item notice to a Company for a returned Check unless such Company and Bank have agreed otherwise.
For the Lockbox Address, each Company will provide to Bank the names of Acceptable Payees (“Acceptable Payee” of a Company means such Company’s name and any other payee name provided to Bank by such Company as an acceptable payee for Checks to be processed under the Lockbox Service).
Bank will process a check only if it is made payable to an Acceptable Payee and if the check is otherwise processable.
A Company may request Bank orally or in writing to make changes to the processing instructions (including changes to Acceptable Payees) for any Lockbox Address by contacting its Bank representative, so long as such changes do not conflict with the terms of the Deposit Account Control Agreement.
Until the Deposit Account Bank shall have received from the Collateral Agent a Notice of Exclusive Control (as defined below), the Obligor shall be entitled to present items drawn on and otherwise to withdraw or direct the disposition of funds from the Deposit Accounts and give instructions in respect of the Deposit
If the Collateral Agent shall give to the Deposit Account Bank a notice of the Collateral Agent’s exclusive control of the Deposit Accounts, which notice states that it is a “Notice of Exclusive Control” (a “Notice of Exclusive Control”), only the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to withdraw funds from the Deposit Accounts, to give any instructions in respect of the Deposit Accounts and any funds held therein or credited thereto or otherwise to deal with the Deposit Accounts.
Such instructions may include the giving of stop payment orders for any items being presented to any Deposit Account for payment.
(a)                                  All account agreements in respect of each Deposit Account in existence on the date hereof are listed on Annex A hereto and copies of all such account agreements have been furnished to the Collateral Agent.
The Deposit Account Bank will promptly furnish to the Collateral Agent a copy of the account agreement for each Deposit Account hereafter established by the Deposit Account Bank for the Obligor.
(e)                                  The Deposit Account Bank will promptly notify the Collateral Agent of each Deposit Account hereafter established by the Deposit Account Bank for the Obligor (which notice shall specify the account number of such Deposit Account and the location at which the Deposit Account is maintained), and each such new Deposit Account shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects.
The Deposit Account Bank agrees, and is hereby authorized and instructed by the Obligor, to furnish to the Collateral Agent at its address indicated below copies of all account statements and other information relating to each Deposit Account that the Deposit Account Bank sends to the Obligor and to disclose to the Collateral Agent all information requested by the Collateral Agent regarding any Deposit Account.

If at any time after the date of this Agreement any Assignor owns, acquires or obtains rights to any As-Extracted Collateral or Timber-to-be-Cut, such Assignor shall furnish the Collateral Agent with prompt written notice thereof (which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the As-Extracted Collateral and/or Timber-to-be-Cut and the locations thereof) and shall take all actions as may be deemed reasonably necessary or desirable by the Collateral Agent to perfect the security interest of the Collateral Agent therein.
If any Inventory or other Goods are at any time in the possession of a bailee, the respective Assignor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, if requested by the Collateral Agent, shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain an acknowledgment from such bailee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, that the bailee holds such Collateral for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall act upon the instructions of the Collateral Agent, without the further consent of the respective Assignor.
Each Assignor will keep and maintain at its own cost and expense accurate records of its Accounts and Contracts, including, but not limited to, originals of all documentation (including each Contract) with respect thereto, records of all payments received, all credits granted thereon, all merchandise returned and all other dealings therewith, and such Assignor will make the same available on such Assignor’s premises to the Collateral Agent for inspection, at such Assignor’s own cost and expense, at any and all reasonable times upon prior notice to such Assignor and otherwise on a basis consistent with the respective Secured Debt Agreements.

Subsequently Acquired Collateral.
If any Pledgor shall acquire (by purchase, stock dividend or similar distribution or otherwise) any additional Collateral at any time or from time to time after the Amendment and Restatement Effective Date, such Collateral shall automatically (and without any further action being required to be taken) be subject to the pledge and security interests created pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof and, furthermore, the respective Pledgor will promptly thereafter take (or cause to be taken) all action with respect to such Collateral in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2 hereof, and will promptly thereafter deliver to the Pledgee (i) a certificate executed by a principal executive officer of such Pledgor describing such Collateral and certifying that the same has been duly pledged in favor of the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Secured Creditors) hereunder and (ii) such supplements to Annexes A through G hereto as are necessary to cause such annexes to be complete and accurate at such time.
Transfer Taxes.
Subject to Section 3.2 hereof, the Pledgee shall be entitled to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral:
No Pledgor will sell or otherwise dispose of, grant any option with respect to, or mortgage, pledge or otherwise encumber any of the Collateral or any interest therein (except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Secured Debt Agreements); provided that Holdings may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of (by dividend, contribution or otherwise) any capital stock or other equity interests (or interests therein) held by Holdings in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any other foreign Person that is not a Subsidiary of the Borrower constituting Collateral, so long as (i) no Default or Event of Default is continuing and (ii) the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent have received a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, signed by a Responsible Officer of Holdings certifying that such Collateral is being sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by Holdings for a business purpose (including, without limitation, that it is being pledged in connection with local financing, sold (in whole or in part), liquidated, exchanged or contributed to a joint venture).
No Pledgor shall establish a new jurisdiction of organization until (i) it shall have given to the Collateral Agent not less than 15 days’ prior written notice of its intention so to do, clearly identifying such new  jurisdiction of organization and providing such other information in connection therewith as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, and (ii) with respect to such new jurisdiction of organization, it shall have taken all action, satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, to maintain the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral intended to be granted hereby at all times fully perfected and in full force and effect.

Each Pledgor will cause the Pledgee to be kept reasonably advised in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, will furnish to the Pledgee such number of prospectuses, offering circulars and other documents incident thereto as the Pledgee from time to time may reasonably request, and will indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, the Pledgee and all other Secured Creditors participating in the distribution of such Collateral consisting of Securities, Limited Liability Company Interests or Partnership Interests against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by an untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such Pledgor by the Pledgee expressly for use therein.
