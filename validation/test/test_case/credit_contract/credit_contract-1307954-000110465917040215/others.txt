As between the Borrower on the one hand, and the applicable Facing Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by the applicable Facing Agent or by the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.

None of the above shall effect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any of the applicable Facing Agent’s or any Lender’s rights or powers hereunder.
In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the applicable Facing Agent under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the applicable Facing Agent under any resulting liability to the Borrower.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the applicable Facing Agent in respect of any claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges or expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the applicable Facing Agent to the extent arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the applicable Facing Agent, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
The right of indemnification in the first paragraph of this Section 2.9(g) shall not prejudice any rights that the Borrower may otherwise have against the applicable Facing Agent with respect to a Letter of Credit issued hereunder.
(h)                                 Stated Amount.
(i)                                     Increased Costs.

97
In determining such additional amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence, the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will, to the extent the increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable or reductions in rates of return relate to the Facing Agent’s or such Lender’s letters of credit in general and are not specifically attributable to the Letters of Credit hereunder, use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and which cover all letters of credit similar to the Letters of Credit issued by or participated in by the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender whether or not the documentation for such other Letters of Credit permit the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender to receive amounts of the type described in this Section 2.9(i).
The certificate required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.9(i) shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower.
(j)                                    Outstanding Letters of Credit.
The letters of credit set forth under the caption “Letters of Credit Outstanding on the Closing Date” as set forth on Schedule 2.9(j) attached to the First Amendment, were issued prior to the Closing Date pursuant to one of the Prior Credit Agreements and will remain outstanding as of the Closing Date and the letters of credit and bank guarantees set forth under the caption “Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees outstanding on the First Amendment Effective Date” were issued pursuant to the credit facility of Huntsman Advanced Materials Holdings LLC or otherwise issued by Facing Agent prior to the First Amendment Effective Date and will remain outstanding as of the First Amendment Effective Date (collectively, the “Outstanding Letters of Credit”).
The Borrower, each Facing Agent and each of the Lenders hereby agree with respect to the Outstanding Letters of Credit that each such Outstanding Letters of Credit, for all purposes under this Agreement, shall, from and after the Closing Date, be deemed to be Letters of Credit governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The Borrower agrees that if DB receives any proceeds in respect of any Letter of Credit providing credit support for a Fifth Amendment Existing Letter of Credit, the Borrower will cause a reduction to occur in the amount of then outstanding Fifth Amendment Existing Letters of Credit in an amount equal to such proceeds.

(a)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12.1, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower shall have the right from time to time, to cause an increase in the Revolving Commitments of the Revolving Lenders (a “Revolving Commitment Increase”) by adding to this Agreement one or more additional Eligible Assignees that are not already Revolving Lenders hereunder and that are reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, each Facing Agent and the Swing Line Lender (each, a “New Revolving Lender”) or by allowing one or more existing Revolving Lenders to increase their respective Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) both before and immediately after giving effect to such Revolving Commitment Increase, no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the effective date of such Revolving Commitment Increase (such date, the “Revolving Commitment Increase Date”), (ii) no such Revolving Commitment Increase shall be in an amount less than $10,000,000 (unless the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments then in effect is greater than $390,000,000), (iii) after giving effect to such Revolving Commitment Increase, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments shall not exceed $600,000,000, (iv) no Revolving Lender’s Revolving Commitment shall be increased without such Revolving Lender’s prior written consent (which consent may be given or withheld in such Revolving Lender’s sole and absolute discretion) and (v) the only Revolving Commitment Increase that may occur on or after the Tenth Amendment Effective Date is a single Revolving Commitment Increase in an aggregate amount not exceeding $200,000,000 on (and subject to the occurrence of) the Eleventh Amendment Effective Date.
The foregoing clause (i) and the following Section 2.10(b) and Section 2.10(e) shall not be applicable to the 2014 Revolving Commitment Increase and the only conditions to the 2014 Revolving Commitment Increase shall be those conditions set forth in Section 4 of the Eleventh Amendment.
(c)                                  On any Revolving Commitment Increase Date, the Revolving Lenders shall purchase and assume (without recourse or warranty) from the Revolving Lenders (i) Revolving Loans, to the extent that there are any Revolving Loans then outstanding, and (ii) undivided participation interests in any outstanding LC Obligations and any outstanding Swing Line Loans, in each case, to the extent necessary to ensure that after giving effect to the Revolving Commitment Increase, each Revolving Lender has outstanding Revolving Loans and participation interests in outstanding LC Obligations and Swing Line Loans equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Commitments.
Each existing Revolving Lender (i) shall be automatically deemed to have assigned any outstanding Revolving Loans on the Revolving Commitment Increase Date and (ii) agrees to take any further steps reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, in each case to the extent deemed necessary by the Administrative Agent to effectuate the provisions of the preceding sentences.
If, on such Revolving Commitment Increase Date, any Revolving Loans have been funded, then the Borrower shall be obligated to pay any breakage fees or
99
costs that are payable pursuant to Section 3.5 in connection with the reallocation of such outstanding Revolving Loans to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.10(c).
Any Non-Extended Term B Dollar Lender not responding within the above time period shall be deemed not to have consented to the Proposed Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes.
(b)                                 With respect to the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans held by the Non-Extended Term B Dollar Lenders that consent to the Proposed Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes (such Loans, the “Consenting Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans”), the Non-Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date shall be extended to the Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date and the other Proposed
100
Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes shall become effective.
Except with respect to the Proposed Non-Extended Term B Extension Changes, the Consenting Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans shall be deemed Extended Term B Dollar Loans for purposes of the Loan Documents.
The Borrower and the Administrative Agent are hereby authorized to, without the consent of any Lenders or any other party, to make such changes to the Loan Documents as are reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Term Facilities and all Incremental Equivalent Debt shall not exceed $1,000,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Incremental Revolving Facilities shall not exceed $200,000,000; provided that any Incremental Revolving Facility shall be effectuated as an increase of the Revolving Facility.
(b)                                 The only conditions to the effectiveness of each series of Incremental Amendment  (but not the conditions to the Revolving Lenders and Swing Line Lender making any Revolving Loan or any Swing Line Loan or the Facing Agent issuing any Letter of Credit) shall be as follows: (i) the Incremental Facility shall rank pari passu in right of payment and of security with the Loans, (ii) immediately prior to, and after giving effect to, the incurrence of such Incremental Facility, no
101
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default shall exist; provided, that with respect to any Incremental Facility incurred to finance an Investment permitted to be incurred hereunder, such Incremental Facility may be incurred irrespective of whether an Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default shall exist, (iii) subject to the proviso below, the representations and warranties contained in the Loan Documents shall be accurate in all material respects immediately prior to, and after giving effect to, the incurrence of such Incremental Facility; provided, that with respect to any Incremental Facility incurred to finance an Investment permitted to be incurred hereunder, such Incremental Facility may be incurred irrespective of whether the representations and warranties required to be made under this clause (iii) are correct (other than with respect to (x) the Specified Representations (with an appropriate modification to the representation and warranty in Section 6.5 such that Solvency is  measured as of the consummation of the relevant Incremental Facility) and (y) if there is an acquisition agreement relating to such Investment, the Target Representations, which representations and warranties in immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall be true and correct in all material respects upon such effectiveness), (iv) the relevant Incremental Facility shall not mature earlier than the maturity date of the Relevant AIY Reference Tranche (excluding, for the purposes of determining the foregoing maturity dates, any springing maturity dates relating to senior secured notes (except to the extent the security therefor is pari passu with the Incremental Facility), senior unsecured notes or subordinated notes, or equivalent credit facilities), (v) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the relevant Incremental Facility shall be no shorter than that of the Relevant AIY Reference Tranche, (vi) subject to clauses (iv) and (v) above, the amortization schedule applicable to any Incremental Term Facility shall be determined by the Borrower and the lenders thereunder, (vii) the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin and the Applicable Base Rate Margin applicable to each Incremental Term Facility will be determined by the Borrower and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Facility; provided that in the event that the All-In Yield applicable to any Incremental Term Facility exceeds the All-In Yield of the Relevant AIY Reference Tranche by more than 50 basis points, then (1) the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin and Applicable Base Rate Margin for the Relevant AIY Reference Tranche shall be automatically increased to the extent necessary so that the All-In Yield of the Relevant AIY Reference Tranche is equal to the All-In Yield of such Incremental Term Facility minus 50 basis points (such increase in the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin and Applicable Base Rate Margin, the “MFN Margin Increase”) and (2) the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin and Applicable Base Rate Margin for each other Term Loan (other than the Relevant AIY Reference Tranche) shall be automatically increased by the MFN Margin Increase; provided, further, that, to the extent the All-In Yield of such Incremental Term Loans is higher than the All-In Yield of the 2014-1 Additional Term Loans, the 2016 Term B Loans, the 2021 Term B Loans or the 2023 Term B Loans due to a Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate “floor” on such Incremental Term Loan being higher than the “floor” for the Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate as applied to the 2014-1 Additional Term Loans, the 2016 Term B Loans, the 2021 Term B Loans or the 2023 Term B Loans, as the case may be, such portion of the MFN Margin Increase as applied to the 2014-1 Additional Term Loans, the 2016 Term B Loans, the 2021 Term B Loans or the 2023 Term B Loans, as the case may be so attributable to such higher “floor” shall be effected solely through an increase in any Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate “floor” applicable to such 2014-1 Additional Term Loans, the 2016 Term B Loans, the 2021 Term B Loans or the 2023 Term B Loans, as the case may be (without reducing the MFN Margin Increase applicable to the other Term Loans), (viii) any Incremental Revolving Facility shall be on identical terms and pursuant to documentation applicable to the Revolving Loan, and (ix) except as otherwise required or permitted in clauses (ii) through (viii) above, all other terms of such Incremental Term Facility, if not consistent with the terms of the existing Term Loans, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (as evidenced by its execution of the applicable Incremental Amendment).
Any Incremental Term Facility may participate on a pro rata basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) as the Term Loans in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments hereunder, as specified in the applicable Incremental Amendment.
102
(c)                                  Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Facility.
Incremental Loans may be made by any existing Lender (it being understood that no existing Lender will have an obligation to make all or any portion of any Incremental Loan) or by any Additional Lender on terms permitted in this Section 2.13 and otherwise on terms reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent; provided that, with respect to any Incremental Revolving Facility, the Administrative Agent, each Facing Agent and the Swing Line Lender shall have consented (in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to any Additional Lender or any existing Lender that is not a Revolving Lender as of the Tenth Amendment Effective Date providing all or a portion of such Incremental Revolving Facility if such consent by the Administrative Agent, the applicable Facing Agent and the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, would be required hereunder, for an assignment of Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments.
(d)                                 Commitments in respect of Incremental Loans shall become Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an “Incremental Amendment”) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, each Additional Lender, if any, and the Administrative Agent.
In connection with such Incremental Amendment, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to request such legal opinions, board resolutions, officers’ certificates, mortgage amendments and other documentation and instruments with respect to the real property collateral, and/or reaffirmation agreements substantially consistent with those delivered on the Ninth Amendment Effective Date (other than changes to such legal opinions resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change to counsel’s form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent).
The Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.13.
The Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Incremental Loans for any purpose not prohibited by this Agreement.
The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
2.14                        Refinancing Amendments.
At any time after the Eleventh Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower may obtain, from any Lender or any Additional Lender, Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of all or any portion of the Term Loans then outstanding under this Agreement, in the form of Refinancing Term Loans or Refinancing Term Loan Commitments in each case pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment; provided that such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness (i) will have such pricing,

premiums and optional prepayment or redemption terms as may be agreed by the Borrower and the lenders thereof, (ii) will have a maturity date that is no earlier than, and will have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity equal to or greater than, the Term Loans being refinanced (excluding, for the purposes of determining the foregoing maturity dates, any springing maturity dates relating to senior secured notes (except to the extent the security therefor is pari passu with the contemplated Refinancing Term Loans), senior unsecured notes or subordinated notes, or equivalent credit facilities), (iii)(A) constitutes Indebtedness of the Borrower that is not guaranteed by any Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, (B) is not secured by any assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary other than the Collateral (and, if secured, the security agreements relating to such Indebtedness are substantially the same as the Collateral Documents (with such changes as are reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent)) and (C) a Senior Representative acting on behalf of the holders of such Indebtedness shall have become party to or otherwise subject to one or more intercreditor agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (iv) will have covenants and events of default (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes pricing, premiums and optional prepayment or redemption terms) that are substantially identical to, or (taken as a whole as determined by the Borrower in its reasonable judgment) are no more favorable to the lenders or holders providing such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness than those applicable to the Term Loans being refinanced are to the Lenders of such Term Loans; provided that the covenants and events of default applicable to such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness may provide for any additional or different financial or other covenants or other provisions that are agreed between the Borrower and the lenders thereof and applicable only during periods after the Latest Maturity Date that is in effect on the date such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness is issued, incurred or obtained; provided, further, that a certificate of a Responsible Officer delivered to the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness, together with a reasonably detailed description of the material covenants and events of default of such Indebtedness or drafts of the documentation relating thereto, stating that the Borrower has determined in good faith that such covenants and events of default satisfy the requirement of this clause (iv) shall be conclusive evidence that such covenants and events of default satisfy such requirement unless the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower within such five (5) Business Day period that it disagrees with such determination (including a description of the basis upon which it disagrees)).
Any Refinancing Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments hereunder, as specified in the applicable Refinancing Amendment.
The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of legal opinions, board resolutions, officers’ certificates, mortgage amendments and other documentation and instruments with respect to real property collateral and/or reaffirmation agreements substantially consistent with those delivered on the Ninth Amendment Effective Date (other than changes to such legal opinions resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change to counsel’s form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent).
Any Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness incurred under this Section 2.14 shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $25,000,000 (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may agree).
Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto (including any amendments necessary to treat the Term Loans and Commitments subject thereto as Refinancing Term Loans and/or Refinancing Term Loan Commitments).
Any Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.14.
104
(a)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time after the Eleventh Amendment Effective Date, pursuant to one or more offers (each, a “New Extension Offer”) made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders holding a particular Class of Loans and/or Commitments with a like maturity date on a pro rata basis (based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the respective Loans and/or Commitments with the same maturity date) and on the same terms to each such Lender, the Borrower may from time to time with the consent of any Lender that shall have accepted such offer extend the maturity date of any Loans and/or Commitments (excluding, for the purposes of determining the foregoing maturity date, any springing maturity dates relating to senior secured notes (except to the extent the security therefor is pari passu with the contemplated New Extended Term loans), senior unsecured notes or subordinated notes, or equivalent credit facilities) and otherwise modify the terms of such Loans and/or Commitments of such Lender pursuant to the terms of the relevant New Extension Offer (including, without limitation, by increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Loans and/or modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such Loans that are Term Loans) (each, a “New Extension”, and each group of Loans and/or Commitments so extended, as well as the original Loans and/or Commitments not so extended, being a “tranche”; any New Extended Term Loans and any New Extended Revolving Commitments and New Extended Revolving Loans shall constitute a separate tranche of Loans from the tranche of Loans and/or Commitments from which they were converted), so long as the following terms are satisfied:  (i) no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default shall exist at the time the notice in respect of a New Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders, and no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default shall exist immediately prior to or after giving effect to the effectiveness of any New Extension, (ii) except as to interest rates, fees, amortization, final maturity date, premium, required prepayment dates and participation in prepayments (which shall, subject to immediately succeeding clauses (iii), (iv) and (v), be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the relevant New Extension Offer), the Loans and Commitments of any Lender (a “New Extending Lender”) extended pursuant to any New Extension (any Term Loans so extended, “New Extended Term Loans” and any Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans so extended, “New Extended Revolving Commitments” and “New Extended Revolving Loans”) shall each have the same terms as the tranche of Term Loans or Revolving Commitments, as applicable, subject to such New Extension Offer (except for covenants or other provisions contained therein applicable only to periods after the then Latest Maturity Date), (iii) the final maturity date of any New Extended Term Loans and of any New Extended Revolving Commitments shall be no earlier than the then applicable Latest Maturity Date at the  time of extension (excluding, for the purposes of determining the foregoing maturity dates, any springing maturity dates relating to senior secured notes (except to the extent the security therefor is pari passu with the contemplated New Extended Term Loans), senior unsecured notes or subordinated notes, or equivalent credit facilities) (provided that in the case of any New Extended Revolving Commitments, such final maturity shall only be required to be no earlier than the final maturity of any then outstanding Revolving Commitments or New Extended Revolving Commitments), (iv) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any New Extended Term Loans and of any New Extended Revolving Commitments shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the applicable Loans and/or Commitments extended thereby, (v) any New Extended Term Loans and any New Extended Revolving Commitments may participate on a pro rata basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments hereunder, as specified in the applicable New Extension Offer, (vi) if the aggregate principal amount of Loans and/or Commitments (calculated on the face amount thereof) in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant New Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Loans and/or Commitments offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such New Extension Offer, then the Loans and/or Commitments of such Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such New Extension Offer, (vii) all documentation in respect of such New Extension shall be consistent with the
105
foregoing, (viii) any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied unless waived by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and (ix) the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin, Applicable Base Rate Margin and any OID applicable to any New Extended Term Loans and any New Extended Revolving Commitments will be determined by the Borrower and the lenders providing such New Extended Term Loans and/or New Extended Revolving Commitments.
(b)                                 With respect to all New Extensions consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15, (i) such New Extensions shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Article IV and (ii) any New Extension Offer is required to be in any minimum amount of $25,000,000 (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may agree), provided that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a “Minimum Extension Condition”) to consummating any such New Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant New Extension Offer in the Borrower’s sole discretion and which may be waived by the Borrower) of Loans and/or Commitments of any or all applicable tranches be tendered.
(c)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.15, in the case of any New Extension of Revolving Commitments and/or Revolving Loans, (i) all borrowings and all prepayments of Revolving Loans shall continue to be made on a ratable basis among all Revolving Lenders, based on the relative amounts of their Revolving Commitments, until the repayment of the Revolving Loans attributable to the non-extended Revolving Commitments on the relevant maturity date, (ii) the allocation of the participation exposure with respect to any then-existing or subsequently issued or made Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan as between the Revolving Commitments of such new tranche and the remaining Revolving Commitments shall be made on a ratable basis in accordance with the relative amounts thereof until the maturity date relating to such non-extended Revolving Commitments has occurred, (iii) no termination of New Extended Revolving Commitments and no repayment of New Extended Revolving Loans accompanied by a corresponding permanent reduction in New Extended Revolving Commitments shall be permitted unless such termination or repayment (and corresponding reduction) is accompanied by at least a pro rata termination or permanent repayment (and corresponding pro rata permanent reduction), as applicable, of each other tranche of Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments (or each other tranche of Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans shall have otherwise been terminated and repaid in full), (iv) as applied to Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans, the maturity date or commitment termination date with respect to the Revolving Commitments may not be extended without the prior written consent of the Facing Agents and the Swing Line Lender, (v) at no time shall there be more than ten different tranches of Term Loans and three different tranches of Revolving Commitments, (vi) for the avoidance of doubt, the Facing Agent Sublimit and the Swing Line Lender Sublimit shall never be increased without the prior written consent of the Facing Agents and the Swing Line Lenders and (vii) in addition to the limitations imposed by the Facing Agent Sublimit and the Swing Line Lender Sublimit, no Letter of Credit shall be issued, and no Swing Line Loan shall be made, if there are Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans with expiry dates and maturity later than the maturity or termination dates of the Revolving Commitments to which they are participated pursuant to clause (ii) of this clause (c).
(d)                                 The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order to establish new tranches or sub-tranches in respect of Loans so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.15.
In connection with any New Extension, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to request such legal opinions, board resolutions, officers’ certificates, mortgage amendments and other documentation and instruments with respect to the real property collateral, and/or reaffirmation agreements substantially consistent with those delivered on
106
the Ninth Amendment Effective Date (other than changes to such legal opinions resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change to counsel’s form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent).
For the avoidance of doubt, no Lender shall be under any obligation to participate in any New Extension Offer or become a New Extending Lender.

Each change in the Applicable Base Rate Margin or Applicable Eurocurrency Margin or the Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage or any change in the LC Commission as a result of a change in the Borrower’s Most Recent Leverage Ratio shall become effective on the date upon which such change in such ratio occurs.
3.4                               Interest Periods.
(i)                                     all Eurocurrency Loans comprising a single Borrowing shall at all times have the same Interest Period;

(iii)                               if any Interest Period relating to a Eurocurrency Loan begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;
(v)                                 at any time when an Event of Default is then in existence, no Interest Period (a) of more than one month may be selected with respect to any Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency and (b) may be selected with respect to any Loan denominated in Dollars;

109
3.5                               Compensation for Funding Losses.
The Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts, showing the calculation thereof in reasonable detail), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any interest paid by such Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurocurrency Loans to the extent not recovered by the Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds and including the compensation payable by such Lender to a Participant) and any loss sustained by such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds (including, without limitation, a return on such liquidation or re-employment that would result in such Lender receiving less than it would have received had such Eurocurrency Loan remained outstanding until the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurocurrency Loans) which such Lender may sustain as a result of: (i) the continuation or Borrowing of, the conversion from or into, a Eurocurrency Loan not occurring on the date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation (whether or not withdrawn for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent)); (ii) any payment, prepayment or conversion or continuation of any of its Eurocurrency Loans occurring for any reason whatsoever on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; (iii) any repayment of any of its Eurocurrency Loans not being made on the date specified in a notice of payment given by the Borrower; or (iv) (A) any other failure by the Borrower to repay its Eurocurrency Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (B) an election made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.7; provided that such written request, including the calculation as to additional amounts owed such Lender under this Section 3.5, is delivered to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be delivered within 30 days of such event.
Absent manifest error, such request shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.
3.6                               Increased Costs, Illegality, Etc.
(a)                                 Generally.
Except as provided in Section 4.7, in the event that any Lender shall have determined, in its reasonable, good faith judgment, (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):
(i)                                     on any Interest Rate Determination Date that, by reason of any change arising after the date of the Closing Date affecting the interbank Eurocurrency market,
110
adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate; or
(ii)                                  at any time that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reduction in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan because of (x) any change arising after the Closing Date in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (or any successor similar authority) or the United States financial regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III shall, in each case, be deemed to be a change in applicable law after the Closing Date for purposes of this Section 3.6(a)(ii) regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued), such as, for example, but not limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender of the principal of or interest on the Notes or any other amounts payable hereunder (except for taxes described in Sections 4.7(a)(i) through (vii)) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements (but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Eurocurrency Rate) and/or (y) other circumstances arising after the Closing Date affecting such Lender or the interbank Eurocurrency market or the position of such Lender in such market (excluding, however, differences in such Lender’s cost of funds from those of the Administrative Agent which are solely the result of credit differences between such Lender and the Administrative Agent); or
(iii)                               at any time that (x) the making or continuance of any Eurocurrency Loan has been made (1) unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or order, or (2) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank Eurocurrency market or (y) compliance by such Lender, acting in good faith, with any governmental request (whether or not having force of law) is impossible;
111
reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (such written demand as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, which shall show the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto); provided, that such Lender shall not be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.6(a)(y) for any change or circumstance referred to in this Section 3.6(a) occurring prior to the 180th day before the making of such demand (unless the change is due to a law enacted with retroactive effect, in which case the 180 day period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect); and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 3.6(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.
In determining such additional amounts pursuant to clause (y) of the immediately preceding sentence, each affected Lender shall act reasonably and in good faith and will, to the extent the increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable relate to such Lender’s loans in general and are not specifically attributable to a Loan hereunder, use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and which cover all loans similar to the Loans made by such Lender whether or not the loan documentation for such other loans permits the Lender to receive increased costs of the type described in this Section 3.6(a).
(b)                                 Eurocurrency Loans.
(c)                                  Capital Requirements.
If any Lender determines that the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency (in each case after the Closing Date) (provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith concerning capital adequacy and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (or any successor similar authority) or the United States financial regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III shall, in each case, be deemed to be a change in applicable law concerning capital adequacy after the Closing Date for purposes of this Section 3.6(c) regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued), will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender’s Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, upon its written notice as hereafter described, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital.
In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and which will, to the extent the increased costs
112
or reduction in the rate of return relates to such Lender’s commitments or obligations in general and are not specifically attributable to the Commitments and obligations hereunder, cover all commitments and obligations similar to the Commitments and obligations of such Lender hereunder whether or not the loan documentation for such other commitments or obligations permits such Lender to make the determination specified in this Section 3.6(c), and such Lender’s determination of compensation owing under this Section 3.6(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.
(d)                                 Change of Lending Office.
Each Lender which is or will be owed compensation pursuant to Section 3.6(a) or (c) or 4.7 will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to cause a different Lending Office to make or continue a Loan or Letter of Credit if such designation will avoid the need for, or materially reduce the amount of, such compensation to such Lender and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or Lending Office.
Nothing in this Section 3.6(d) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided for herein.
3.7                               Replacement of Affected Lenders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, no Lender that acts as a Facing Agent may be replaced hereunder at any time during which such Facing Agent has Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder,
113
unless arrangements satisfactory to such Facing Agent (including (1) the furnishing of a standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, satisfactory to such Facing Agent or (2) the depositing of cash collateral into a collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to such Facing Agent) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit.
3.8                               Impaired Lenders.
(a)                                 Reallocation of Impaired Lender Commitment.
If a Revolving Lender becomes an Impaired Lender, the following provisions shall apply with respect to any outstanding LC Obligations and any outstanding Swing Line Loans for so long as such Revolving Lender is an Impaired Lender:
(i)                                     the Pro Rata Share of such Impaired Lender with respect to any LC Obligations and any outstanding Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated (effective on the date such Lender becomes an Impaired Lender, but without releasing such Impaired Lender from any of its obligations or commitments) among the Revolving Lenders that are Non-Impaired Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments but only to the extent the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each of the Non-Impaired Lenders’ Revolving Loans plus each of the Non-Impaired Lenders’ Pro Rata Share of the LC Obligations and Swing Line Loans does not exceed the total of all Non-Impaired Lenders’ Revolving Commitments; provided, that no such reallocation will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Facing Agent, the Swing Line Lender or any other Revolving Lender may have against such Impaired Lender (including any claim for contribution made by a Non-Impaired Lender in respect of amounts funded by such Non-Impaired Lender pursuant to such reallocation of commitments) or cause such Impaired Lender to be a Non-Impaired Lender;
(iii)                               any amount paid by the Borrower or otherwise received for the account of an Impaired Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be distributed to such Impaired Lender within the meaning of clause (i), (ii)(x) or (iii) of the definition of Impaired Lender (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Obligations for which such amount is paid for the account of such Impaired Lender will be satisfied and discharged in full when paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent), and such amount will instead be
114

ARTICLE VI
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans, and issue (or participate in) the Letters of Credit as provided herein, the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as of the Third Amendment Effective Date and as of the date of each
145
subsequent Credit Event, all of which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the making of the Loans and issuance of the Letters of Credit:
6.1                               Corporate Status.
The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation, partnership or limited liability company or other entity in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization (or the equivalent thereof in the case of Foreign Subsidiaries), (ii) has the requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and presently proposed to engage in and (iii) is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing (where relevant) in (y) its jurisdiction of organization and (z) each other jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, authorization or good standing, except (1) for such failure to be so qualified, authorized or in good standing which, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (2) as a result of any transaction expressly permitted under Section 8.3 hereof.
6.2                               Corporate Power and Authority.
The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has the applicable power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each of the Documents to which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate or other appropriate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each of such Documents.
As of the Third Amendment Effective Date (or such later date as a Document is to be executed and delivered in accordance with the terms hereof) the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has duly executed and delivered each of the Documents to which it is a party, and each of such Documents constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws generally affecting creditors’ rights and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).
Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries of the Documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the granting of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents), nor compliance by it with the terms and provisions thereof, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein (i) will contravene any provision of any Requirement of Law applicable to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) will conflict with or result in any breach of or constitute a tortious interference with any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien (except pursuant to the Security Documents) upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any material Contractual Obligation to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets is bound or to which it may be subject, (iii) will violate any provision of any Organizational Document of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) require any approval of stockholders or any approval or consent of any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) except as have been obtained on or prior to the Third Amendment Effective Date.
6.4                               Governmental and Other Approvals.

146
authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with (except as have been obtained or made on or prior to the Closing Date), or exemption by, any Governmental Authority, is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, (i) the execution, delivery and performance of any Document or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any such Document.

On and as of the Third Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower believes that the Projections are reasonable and attainable, it being understood that uncertainty is inherent in any forecast or projection and that no assurance can be given that the results set forth in the Projections will actually be attained or that the projections will be suitable or sufficient for any purpose relevant to the Lenders.
(f)                                   No Material Adverse Change.
As of the Third Amendment Effective Date and at any time thereafter, there has been no material adverse change in the business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities or operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) since December 31, 2006 based on the financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.5(a).

As of the Third Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders on or before the Third Amendment Effective Date, all contractual, corporate or other restrictions to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is or will be subject as of the Third Amendment Effective Date, and all other matters known to any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

11.8                        Holders of Obligations.
The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Obligation as reflected on the books and records of the Administrative Agent as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.8(c).
Any request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Obligation
191

12.4                        Costs, Expenses and Taxes.
(a)                                 Generally.
The Borrower agrees (without duplication) to pay all reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation, printing, typing, reproduction, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the documents and instruments referred to herein and therein and any amendment, waiver, consent relating hereto or thereto or other modifications of (or supplements to) any of the foregoing and any and all other documents and instruments furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith, including without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of Shearman & Sterling LLP, special counsel to the Administrative Agent and the UK Security Trustee, and any local counsel retained by the Administrative Agent relative thereto or the reasonable allocated costs of staff counsel as well as the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel, independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by the Administrative Agent or the UK Security Trustee in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and all search fees, appraisal fees and expenses, title insurance policy fees, costs and expenses and filing and recording fees and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, Attorney Costs), if any, of the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee and the Lenders in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, any of the Loan Documents or any other agreement furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith.
In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all present and future stamp, documentary transfer, excise, property, and other similar taxes payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution, delivery or enforcement of this Agreement, any Loan Document, or otherwise with respect to or in connection with any Loan Document, or the making of any Loan (other than taxes based on the net income of the Lenders), and agrees to save and hold the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee and each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay by the Borrower in paying, or omission by the Borrower to pay, such taxes.
Any portion of the
198
Subject to Section 4.7, the Borrower will indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee, each Agent and each Lender and each director, officer, employee, partner, advisor, agent, attorney, trustee and Affiliate of the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee, each Agent and each Lender (each such Person an “Indemnified Party”) from and against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, obligations (including removal or remedial actions), expenses or liabilities which arise out of, in any way relate to, or result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and to reimburse each Indemnified Party upon their demand, for any Attorney Costs incurred in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or claim; provided, however, (a) that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be so indemnified hereunder for any loss, claim, damage, penalties, obligations, expense or liability to the extent it arises or results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnified Party as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and (b) that nothing contained herein shall affect the obligations and liabilities of the Lenders to the Borrower contained herein.
If any action, suit or proceeding arising from any of the foregoing is brought against the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee, any Agent, any Lender or any other Indemnified Party, the Borrower will, if requested by the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee, any Agent, any Lender or any such Indemnified Party, resist and defend such action, suit or proceeding or cause the same to be resisted and defended by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Person or Persons indemnified or intended to be indemnified.
Each Indemnified Party shall, unless the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee, an Agent, a Lender or other Indemnified Party has made the request described in the preceding sentence and such request has been complied with, have the right to employ its own counsel (or (but not as well as) staff counsel) to investigate and control the defense of any matter covered by such indemnity and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Excluding any liability to the extent arising out of the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Indemnified Party as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Borrower further agrees to indemnify and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from all loss, cost (including Attorney Costs), liability and damage whatsoever incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of any violation of any Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or for the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminants into the environment for which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or which occurs upon the Mortgaged Property or which is related to any property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or by reason of the imposition of any Environmental Lien in respect of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or which occurs by a breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants relating to environmental matters contained herein, provided that, with respect to any liabilities arising from acts or failure to act for which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is strictly liable under any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit, the Borrower’s obligation to each Indemnified Party under this indemnity shall likewise be without regard to fault on the part of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary.
If the Borrower shall fail to do any act or thing which it has covenanted to do hereunder or any representation or warranty on the part of the Borrower or any Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be breached, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) do the same or cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and may expend its funds for such purpose, and will use its best efforts to give prompt written notice to the Borrower that it proposes to take such action.
To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the UK Security Trustee or any Lender as set forth in this Section 12.4 may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, the
199
Borrower shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.
The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 12.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the assignment by any Lender of all or any part of its Credit Exposure hereunder and the discharge of the Borrower’s other Obligations hereunder.
Except as specifically provided for in this Agreement, no party hereto shall be entitled to recover from any other party hereto any amount in respect of exemplary, punitive, special, indirect, remote, or speculative damages, including lost profits.
(b)                                 Foreign Exchange Indemnity.
If any sum due from the Borrower under this Agreement or any order or judgment given or made in relation hereto has to be converted from the currency (the “first currency”) in which the same is payable hereunder or under such order or judgment into another currency (the “second currency”) for the purpose of (i) making or filing a claim or proof against the Borrower with any Governmental Authority or in any court or tribunal, or (ii) enforcing any order or judgment given or made in relation hereto, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Persons to whom such sum is due from and against any loss actually suffered as a result of any discrepancy between (a) the rate of exchange used to convert the amount in question from the first currency into the second currency, and (b) the rate or rates of exchange at which such Person, acting in good faith in a commercially reasonable manner, purchased the first currency with the second currency after receipt of a sum paid to it in the second currency in satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any such order, judgment, claim or proof.
The foregoing indemnity shall constitute a separate obligation of the Borrower distinct from its other obligations hereunder and shall survive the giving or making of any judgment or order in relation to all or any of such other obligations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments of principal and interest on Loans denominated in Euros, Sterling or an Alternative Currency, as the case may be, shall be made in Euros, Sterling or such Alternative Currency, as the case may be.
(c)                                  Notwithstanding the resignation of the Resigning Agent as of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower agrees that the provisions of this Section 12.4 and any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document regarding payment of costs and expenses and indemnification of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, together with any provision of any Loan Document that shall accrue to the benefit of any retiring or resigning Agent, shall continue to inure to the benefit of the Resigning Agent on and following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date with respect to actions of the Resigning Agent taken (i) on or prior to the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, and (ii) subsequent to the Fifth Amendment Effective Date pursuant to the Loan Documents or that certain Successor Agency Agreement, dated as of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, by and among JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Resigning Agent and the Borrower.
DB shall be a third party beneficiary for purposes of this Section 12.4(c).
12.5                        Confirmations.
12.6                        Adjustment; Setoff.
(a)                                 If any lender (a “Benefited Lender”) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10.1(e) or Section 10.1(f) hereof, or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and collateral received by any other Lender in respect of such other Lender’s Loans or interest thereon not expressly
200
provided hereby, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other Lender’s Loans, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each Lender except to the extent expressly provided hereby; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest unless the Benefited Lender from which such excess payment is recovered is required by court order to pay interest thereon, in which case each Lender returning funds to such Benefited Lender shall pay its pro rata share of such interest.
The Borrower agrees that each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender’s Loans may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of setoff) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.
(b)                                 In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to setoff and apply against any Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower to such Lender, any amount owing from such Lender to the Borrower, at or at any time after, the happening of any of the above-mentioned events, and the aforesaid right of setoff may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against, the Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of setoff shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the making, filing or issuance, or service upon such Lender of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant.
(c)                                  The Borrower expressly agrees that to the extent the Borrower makes a payment or payments and such payment or payments, or any part thereof, are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or are required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other party under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Indebtedness to the Lenders or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment or payments had not been made.
12.7                        Execution in Counterparts.
(a)                                 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.
(b)                                 Electronic Execution of Assignments.
The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State
201
Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
12.8                        Binding Effect; Assignment; Addition and Substitution of Lenders.
(a)                                 This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Resigning Agent, the Lenders, all future holders of the Notes and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that the Borrower may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder or in connection herewith or any interest herein (voluntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and all of the Lenders.
(b)                                 Each Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities (“Participants”) participating interests in all or any portion of its Commitment and Loans or participation in Letters of Credit or any other interest of such Lender hereunder (in respect of any Lender, its “Credit Exposure”).
In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Further, the Participant shall be subject to the obligations of Section 3.6 and Section 4.7 as if such Participant was a Lender.
The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided, however, that such right of setoff shall be subject to the obligation of such Participant to share with the Lenders, and the Lenders agree to share with such Participant, as provided in Section 12.6.
The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.6 and Section 4.7 with respect to its participation in the Loans outstanding from time to time, as if such Participant becomes a Lender on the date it acquired an interest pursuant to this Section 12.8(b); provided that, no participation shall be made to any Person under this section if, at the time of such participation, the Participant’s benefits under Section 3.6 or Section 4.7 would be greater than the benefits that the participating Lender was entitled to under Section 3.6 or Section 4.7 (and if any participation is made in violation of the foregoing, the Participant will not be entitled to the incremental amounts).
Each Lender agrees that any agreement between such Lender and any such Participant in respect of such participating interest shall not restrict such Lender’s right to approve or agree to any amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification to, waiver of, or consent under, this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents except to the extent that any of the foregoing would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in which such Participant is participating (it being understood that amending the definition of any Scheduled Non-Extended Term B Dollar Repayments (other than the Non-Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date) shall not constitute an extension of the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note) or extend the stated maturity of any Letter of Credit in which such Participant is participating beyond the Revolver Termination Date, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees on any such Loan, Note or Letter of Credit (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the Participant’s participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, representations, warranties, Events of Default or Unmatured Events of
202
Default or of a mandatory reduction in Commitments shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any Participant if the Participant’s participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security Documents (except as expressly provided in the Loan Documents) supporting the Loans and/or Letters of Credit hereunder in which such Participant is participating.
Each Assignee shall take such Credit Exposure subject to the provisions of this Agreement and to any request made, waiver or consent given or other action taken hereunder, prior to the
203
Such Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement and Schedule 1.1(a) hereto, to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Assignee as a Lender and the resulting adjustment of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement, the Maximum Commitment, the determination of its Pro Rata Share (rounded to twelve decimal places), the Loans, any outstanding Letters of Credit and any new Notes, if requested, to be issued, at the Borrower’s expense, to such Assignee, and no further consent or action by the Borrower or the Lenders shall be required to effect such amendments.
No assignment by any Lender of all or any part of its Credit Exposure may be made to the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower except as permitted under Section 4.3(c) or Section 12.8(g).
(e)                                  Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time pledge or assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the Notes held by it) to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board without notice to, or the consent of, the Borrower, provided that, no such pledge or assignment of a security interest under this Section 12.8(e) shall release a Lender from any obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
Any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or any portion of its Notes or Loans to its trustee or its security holders in support of its obligations to its trustee.
No such pledge or assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by all of the other parties hereto, no Lender shall, by reason of the transfer of a Note or otherwise, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder.
Each transferee of any Note shall take such Note subject to the provisions of this Agreement and to any request made, waiver or consent given or other action taken hereunder, prior to the receipt by Administrative Agent and Borrower of written notice of such transfer, by each previous holder of such Note, and, except as expressly otherwise provided in such transfer, Administrative Agent and Borrower shall be entitled conclusively to assume that the transferee named in such notice shall hereafter be vested with all rights and powers under this Agreement with respect to the Pro Rata Share of the Loans of the Lender named as the payee of the Note which is the subject of such transfer.
(g)                                  Any Lender may, so long as (x) no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) no proceeds of Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans are used for this purpose, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to Term Loans under this Agreement (i) to the Borrower through Dutch auctions or other offers to purchase open to all Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with procedures of the type described in Section 4.3(c) or (ii) notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries through open-market purchases on a non-pro rata basis; provided, that: (1) if the assignee is a Subsidiary
204
(C)                               EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHT, POWER OR REMEDY UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.
205
12.11                 Severability of Provisions.
Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
12.12                 Headings.
The Table of Contents and Article and Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained in any Loan Document, the Tenth Amendment Fee Letter shall survive the Tenth Amendment Effective Date and the Eleventh Amendment Effective Date, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the Lenders hereby authorize the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to make, without the consent of any other party, any changes to the Loan Documents that the Borrower may be required to make pursuant to the terms of the Tenth Amendment Fee Letter.
12.14                 Confidentiality.
Each of the Lenders severally agrees to keep confidential all non-public information pertaining to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors in interest which is provided to it by any such parties in accordance with such Lender’s customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature and in a prudent fashion, and shall not disclose such information to any Person except (i) to the extent such information is public when received by such Lender or becomes public thereafter due to the act or omission of any party other than a Lender, (ii) to the extent such information is independently obtained from a source other than the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and such information from such source is not, to such Lender’s knowledge, subject to an obligation of confidentiality or, if such information is subject to an obligation of confidentiality, that disclosure of such information is permitted, (iii) to an Affiliate of such Lender (or its investment advisor), counsel, auditors, ratings agencies, examiners of any regulatory authority having or asserting jurisdiction over such Lender, accountants and other consultants retained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or to any Affiliate of a Lender which is a direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements with the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower or such contractual counterparty’s professional advisor (so long as such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 12.14) or to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with rating issued with respect to such Lender, (iv) in connection with any litigation or the enforcement of the rights of any Lender or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (v) to the extent (x) required by any applicable statute, rule or regulation or court order (including, without limitation, by way of subpoena) or pursuant to the request of any Governmental Authority having or asserting jurisdiction over any Lender or the
206
Administrative Agent or any of their respective affiliates; provided, however, that in such event, if the Lender(s) are not legally prohibited from doing so, the Lender shall provide the Borrower with prompt notice of such requested disclosure so that the Borrower may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and, in any event, the Lenders will endeavor in good faith to provide only that portion of such information which, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender(s), is relevant and legally required to be provided (y) requested by any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with rating issued with respect to such Lender or (z) requested by any pledgee referred to in Section 12.8(e) or a direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements with a Lender or a Person that such Lender is a direct or indirect counterparty in a swap agreement or such contractual counterparty’s professional advisor (so long as such pledgee or contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 12.14) or (vi) to the extent disclosure to other entities is appropriate in connection with any proposed or actual assignment or grant of a participation by any of the Lenders of interests in this Agreement and/or any of the other Loan Documents to such other entities (who will in turn be required to maintain confidentiality as if they were Lenders parties to this Agreement).
In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated or required to return any such information or other materials furnished by the Borrower.
12.15                 Concerning the Collateral and the Loan Documents.
(a)                                 Authority.
Each Lender authorizes and directs JPMCB and/or its designated affiliate to act as Collateral Agent under the Collateral Security Agreement and or UK Security Trustee under the UK Security Documents and to enter into the Loan Documents relating to the Collateral (including, without limitation, the Collateral Security Agreement) for the benefit of the Lenders and the other Secured Parties.
Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, where required by the express terms hereof, a different proportion of the Lenders) in accordance with the provisions hereof or of the other Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the UK Security Trustee or the Required Lenders (or, where so required, such different proportion) of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to (i) act as the disbursing and collecting agent for the Lenders with respect to all payments and collections arising in connection herewith and with the Loan Documents relating to the Collateral; (ii) execute and deliver each Loan Document relating to the Collateral and accept delivery of each such agreement delivered by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) act as Collateral Agent for the Lenders and certain other Secured Parties for purposes stated in the Security Documents to the extent such perfection is required under the Loan Documents, provided, however, the Collateral Agent hereby appoints, authorizes and directs each Lender to act as collateral sub-agent for the Collateral Agent and the Lenders for purposes of the perfection of all security interests and Liens with respect to the Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective deposit accounts maintained with, and cash and Cash Equivalents held by, such Lender; (iv) manage, supervise and otherwise deal with the Collateral; (v) take such action as is necessary or desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the security interests and liens created or purported to be created by the Loan Documents, and (vi) except as may be otherwise specifically restricted by the terms hereof or of any other Loan Document, exercise all remedies given to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect to the Collateral under the Loan Documents relating thereto, applicable law or otherwise.
(b)                                 Release of Collateral.
(i)                                     The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby direct the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the UK Security Trustee, as the case may
207
(A)                               against all of the Collateral, upon final and indefeasible payment in full of the Loans and Obligations and termination hereof;
(B)                               against any part of the Collateral sold, transferred or disposed of by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (including, subject to the satisfaction of the Venator Release Conditions, releases to be effective upon the consummation of the Initial Venator IPO Transaction with respect to Collateral sold, transferred or disposed of to Venator and its Subsidiaries) (x) to the extent such sale, transfer or disposition is permitted hereby (or permitted pursuant to a waiver or consent of a transaction otherwise prohibited hereby) and (y) subject to the satisfaction of the Venator Release Conditions and the consummation of the Initial Venator IPO Transaction, in connection with the Venator IPO Transactions;
(E)                                against a part of the Collateral which release does not require the consent of all of the Lenders as set forth in Section 12.1(a)(ii), if such release is consented to by the Required Lenders;
(F)                                 against the Collateral consisting of Receivables Facility Assets upon the entry by the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries into a Permitted Accounts Receivables Securitization; provided, however, that (y) neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent nor the UK Security Trustee shall be required to execute any such document on terms which, in its opinion, would expose it to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (z) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of) all interests retained by the Borrower and/or any of its Subsidiaries, including (without limitation) the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral; and
208
(H)                              against any Specified Property;
(I)                                   upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by this Agreement occurring after the Seventeenth Amendment Effective Date, as a result of which (1) a Subsidiary Guarantor is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor would no longer be required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 7.11(b), against any Collateral of such Subsidiary (and if applicable, against any Capital Stock of such Subsidiary to the extent a pledge of such Capital Stock would no longer be required pursuant to Section 7.11(c) or (e)); and
(J)                                   upon any Venator Foreign Contribution, against any Collateral subject to such Venator Foreign Contribution.
(c)                                  No Obligation.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent nor the UK Security Trustee shall have any obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the UK Security Trustee herein or pursuant to the Loan Documents have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the UK Security Trustee in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, the Administrative Agent the Collateral Agent or the UK Security Trustee may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, given the Administrative Agent’s, the Collateral Agent’s and the UK Security Trustee’s own interests in the Collateral as one of the Lenders and that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent nor the UK Security Trustee shall have any duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender, provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the UK Security Trustee shall be responsible for their respective grossly negligent actions or actions constituting intentional misconduct.
(d)                                 Senior Secured Note Liens.
Each Lender hereby instructs Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into the Collateral Security Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and the UK Security Trustee to enter into the UK Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and such amendments or modifications thereto and to the other Security Documents consistent herewith and as Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent or the UK Security Trustee reasonably determines to be necessary to cause the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations (other than the Capital Stock Collateral) to be pari passu with the Liens on the Senior Secured Note Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).
Each Lender agrees that it shall not challenge or question in any proceeding
209
the validity or enforceability of this Section 12.15(d) or any corresponding provisions with respect thereto in the Collateral Security Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement.
12.16                 Intentionally Omitted.
The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower’s agent, solely for purposes of this Section 12.17 to maintain a register (the “Register”) on which it will record the Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.
Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation shall not affect the Borrower’s obligations in respect of such Loans.
With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor.
The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 12.8(c).
The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 12.17.
12.18                 Accounts Receivable Securitization.
(a)                                 By its execution of this Agreement, each Lender agrees, for the benefit of the holders from time to time of interests in trade receivables under the Permitted Accounts Receivables Securitization not to:
(i)                                     challenge the “true sale” characterization of the sales and transfers of Accounts Receivables by the Borrower or any Participating Subsidiary to a Receivables Subsidiary pursuant to a Permitted Accounts Receivables Securitization;
(ii)                                  join in any proceeding in whole or in part to commence or consent to the commencement of a case against a Receivables Subsidiary under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar federal or state law or file a petition seeking or consenting to reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law relating to bankruptcy, or seek or consent to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of a Receivables Subsidiary or any substantial part of its assets; or
(iii)                               assert or consent to any attempt by any person to assert that a Receivables Subsidiary should be substantively consolidated with the Borrower or any other Subsidiary.
210
(b)                                 By its execution of this Agreement, each Lender further authorizes the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the UK Security trustee, in each case, with the approval of the Administrative Agent, to enter into an intercreditor agreement with the Persons providing a Permitted Accounts Receivables Securitization as long as the provisions of any such agreement are not materially more burdensome to the Lenders than are typical for like receivables transactions.
12.19                 Certain Guarantee Obligations.
The Borrower hereby guarantees all obligations of each of its Subsidiaries (for so long as such Subsidiary remains a Subsidiary) under all Interest Rate Agreements and Other Hedging Agreements entered into by such Subsidiary with any Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender (even if such Person subsequently ceases to be a Lender hereunder for any reason), which obligations are pursuant to the terms of such Interest Rate Agreements and Other Hedging Agreements expressly secured by the security interests granted under the Collateral Security Agreement.
The provisions of Sections 4 through 9 of the Subsidiary Guaranty are hereby incorporated herein by reference mutatis mutandis as if all references to “Guarantor” and “Guaranteed Obligations” were references to the Borrower and the obligations guaranteed by this Section 12.19, respectively.
12.20                 Redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
Effective at the time of delivery of the certificate required pursuant to clause (vi) above, the Unrestricted Subsidiary Investment Basket shall be increased by (A) if such Unrestricted Subsidiary was so designated after the Third Amendment Effective Date, the fair market value of such Subsidiary or (B) if such Unrestricted Subsidiary was so designated on the Third Amendment Effective Date, the lesser of (y) the aggregate amount of outstanding Investments made after the Third Amendment Effective Date by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary or (z) the fair market value of such Unrestricted Subsidiary immediately prior to the effective date of such redesignation.
The Borrower agrees that any merger or consolidation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary with or into Borrower or any Subsidiary shall be required to satisfy the conditions of this Section 12.20 prior to completing any such
211
transaction.
If Venator and its Subsidiaries are designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in connection with the Initial Venator IPO Transaction, they may not be redesignated as Restricted Subsidiaries.
12.21                 Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent as Joint Creditors.
Each of the Credit Parties and each Lender and Agent and the Collateral Agent agrees that each of the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall be a joint and several creditor (in Dutch: hoofdelijk schuldeiser) (together with the relevant Lender or Agent) of the Obligations and Guaranteed Obligations owed to each Lender or Agent under or in connection with all Loan Documents and that accordingly each of the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent will have its own independent right to demand payment and performance by the obligors of such obligations.
However, any discharge of a Credit Party of any such obligation to the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or any other relevant Lender, Agent or creditor referred to above, shall, to the same extent, discharge such Credit Party vis-à-vis the others in respect of such obligation, and a Lender, Agent and the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall not by virtue of this Section be entitled to pursue a Credit Party concurrently for the same obligation.
12.22                 Amendment With Respect to Revolver Events of Default.
No amendment, modification or waiver of Section 9.1, any of the financial definitions used in determining compliance with Section 9.1 or this Section 12.22 or waiver of any Revolver Event of Default, may be effected without the consent of the Majority Lenders under the Revolving Facility.
12.23                 Term C Dollar Lenders.
Each Term C Dollar Lender agrees that upon the earlier to occur of (x) the Non-Extended Term B Loan Maturity Date and (y) the date that all Non-Extended Term B Dollar Loans are prepaid or repaid in full (for any reason) (such earlier date, the “Determination Date”):
(a)                                 Without limitation of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or any provisions thereof, the Borrower shall have the right in its sole discretion at any time to refinance or replace all of the Facilities outstanding immediately prior to the Determination Date under this Agreement (other than the Term C Dollar Facility) (collectively, the “Refinanced Facility Debt”) pursuant to separate credit documentation.
In connection therewith:
(i)                                     all collateral, guarantees and other credit support that secures, guarantees or otherwise supports the Term C Dollar Facility pursuant to the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the Security Documents) shall be available (on a pari passu basis in payment and lien priority, and in any event on the same basis as the Facilities are afforded under the Loan Documents as of the Fourth Amendment Effective Date) to secure, guarantee or otherwise support any and all such Refinanced Facility Debt, together with any other senior secured indebtedness of the Borrower (including, without limitation, one or more revolving and/or term credit facilities), in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (A) the principal amount of Refinanced Facility Debt outstanding on the Determination Date (or its equivalent in any other currency) and (B) $2,100,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) (such greater amount, the “Minimum Floor Amount”), as the Minimum Floor Amount may be reduced after the Determination Date pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of “Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness”; and
212
(ii)                                  the Loan Documents shall be amended and other documents and agreements will be entered into (such amendments, documents and agreements solely requiring the signatures of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to be effective) in order to effectuate the foregoing and to make any necessary conforming changes.
(c)                                  Article IX shall no longer apply for any purpose under this Agreement (including, without limitation, for the purposes of Section 2.1(a)(ii), Section 7.2(b), Section 8.7(j) and Section 8.7(m)).
(d)                                 “Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness” shall mean, with respect to any Indebtedness, any Indebtedness refinancing, extending, renewing or refunding such Indebtedness; provided, however, that any such refinancing Indebtedness shall (i) be issued by the same obligor as the Indebtedness being so refinanced (or by Huntsman Corporation or a Parent Company) and be on terms, taken as a whole, not more restrictive than the terms of the documents governing the Indebtedness being so refinanced; (ii) if the Indebtedness being so refinanced is subordinated to the Obligations, be subordinated to the Obligations on substantially the same terms (or on terms at least as favorable to the Lenders) as Indebtedness being so refinanced; (iii) be in a principal amount (as determined as of the date of the incurrence of such refinancing Indebtedness in accordance with GAAP) not exceeding the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced on such date plus any call premiums, prepayment fees, costs and expenses paid in connection with such refinancing; (iv) not have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity less than the Indebtedness being refinanced; (v) if the Indebtedness being refinanced is Public Notes, be unsecured Indebtedness maturing no earlier than the then latest Term Maturity Date; and (vi) be upon terms and subject to documentation which is in form and substance reasonably satisfactory in all material respects to the Administrative Agent.
Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (v) above, after the Determination Date, any such Indebtedness refinancing, extending, renewing or refunding the Senior Subordinated Notes (2013), the Senior Subordinated Notes (2014), the Senior Subordinated Notes (2015), any similar senior subordinated notes, any senior unsecured notes and any senior secured notes may be senior second-lien notes, senior unsecured notes and, to the extent capacity exists pursuant to the Minimum Floor Amount, senior first-lien secured notes (provided that the Minimum Floor Amount shall be reduced after the Determination Date by the aggregate principal amount of any senior first-lien secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this sentence, unless such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness refinances, extends, renews or refunds senior first-lien secured Indebtedness).
