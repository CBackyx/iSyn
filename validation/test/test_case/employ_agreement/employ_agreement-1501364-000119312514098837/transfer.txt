Exhibit 10.18
The Bank will provide Executive with a copy of such release simultaneously with or as soon as administratively practicable following the delivery of the notice of termination provided in Sections 6 and 7 of this Agreement, but not later than 21 days before (45 days before if Executive’s termination is part of an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees) Executive’s termination of employment.
Executive shall deliver the executed release to the Bank eight days before the date provided in Section 7(g) of this Agreement for the payment of the termination payments and benefits payable under Sections 6 and 7 of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not forfeit any option unless and until there shall have been delivered to him, within six months after the Board (i) had knowledge of conduct or an event allegedly constituting grounds for such forfeiture and (ii) had reason to believe that such conduct or event could be grounds for such forfeiture, a copy of a resolution duly adopted by a majority affirmative vote of the membership of the Board (excluding Executive) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after giving Executive reasonable notice specifying the nature of the grounds for such forfeiture and not less than 30 days to correct the acts or omissions complained of, if correctable, and affording Executive the opportunity, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, Executive has engaged and continues to engage in conduct set forth in this Section 10(f) which constitutes grounds for forfeiture of Executive’s options; provided, however, that if any option is exercised after delivery of such notice and the Board subsequently makes the determination described in this sentence, Executive shall be required to pay to the Company an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate value of the shares acquired upon such exercise at the date of the Board determination and the aggregate exercise price paid by Executive.
