For purposes of calculating each Interest Coverage Ratio: (i) the expected interest income on Floating Rate Collateral Debt Securities, Eligible Investments and under the Hedge Agreements and the expected interest payable on the Notes will be calculated using the interest rates applicable thereto on the applicable Measurement Date; (ii) accrued original issue discount on Eligible Investments will be deemed to be a scheduled interest payment thereon due on the date such original issue discount is scheduled to be paid; (iii) payments made by the Basis Swap Counterparty pursuant to the Basis Swap will not constitute scheduled interest on any Class of Notes; and (iv) it will be assumed that no principal payments are made on the Notes during the applicable periods.
52
(d) For each Due Period, the Scheduled Distribution on any Pledged Security (other than (A) a Defaulted Security or (B) a Deferred Interest Collateral Debt Security, which in either case, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be assumed to have a Scheduled Distribution of zero) shall be the sum of (x) the total amount of payments and collections in respect of such Pledged Security that, if paid as scheduled, will be available in the Collection Accounts at the end of the Due Period for payment on the Notes and of certain expenses of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, plus (y) any such amounts received in prior Due Periods that were not disbursed on a previous Distribution Date; provided, that such sum shall be computed without regard to any amounts excluded from the determination of compliance with the Coverage Tests pursuant to Section 1.2(c).
(e) Subject to Section 1.2(c), each Scheduled Distribution receivable with respect to a Pledged Security shall be assumed to be received on the applicable Due Date, and each such Scheduled Distribution shall be assumed to be immediately deposited in the Interest Collection Account or the Principal Collection Account, as the case may be.
All such funds shall be assumed to continue to earn interest until the date on which they are required to be available in the Collection Accounts for transfer to the Payment Account and application, in accordance with the terms hereof, to payments of principal of or interest and the Commitment Fee on the Notes or other amounts payable pursuant to this Indenture.
(f) With respect to any Collateral Debt Security as to which any interest or other payment thereon is subject to withholding tax of any Relevant Jurisdiction, each Distribution thereon shall, for purposes of the Coverage Tests, be deemed to be payable net of such withholding tax unless the issuer thereof or obligor thereon is required to make additional payments sufficient on an after tax basis to cover any withholding tax imposed on payments to the Issuer with respect thereto.
On any date of determination, the amount of any Scheduled Distribution due on any future date shall be assumed to be made net of any such uncompensated withholding tax based upon withholding tax rates in effect on such date of determination.
(h) For the purpose of determining any payment to be made on any Distribution Date pursuant to any applicable clause of Section 11.1(a), any Coverage Test referred to in such clause shall be calculated as of the relevant Distribution Date after giving effect to all payments to be made on such Distribution Date prior to such payment in accordance with such clause of Section 11.1(a).
In addition, for purposes of determining whether any Interest Coverage Test is satisfied pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), if a payment of principal of any Class of Notes is to be made at the same level or at a more senior level in the Priority of Payments set forth in Section 11.1(a)(i), then the related Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated on a pro forma basis on the assumption that (i) such payment of principal had been made on the immediately preceding Distribution Date and (ii) the Interest Distribution Amount for such Class of Notes for the current Distribution Date was correspondingly reduced to reflect the lower Aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of such Class of Notes.
53
(i) For the purpose of interpreting the definitions of Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds, all payments of interest received or amounts collected that are attributable to interest received on the Collateral Debt Securities during the relevant Due Period shall be excluded from Interest Proceeds and included in Principal Proceeds to the extent such payments or amounts constitute accrued interest purchased with Principal Proceeds.

and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee) and of the Noteholders allowed in any Proceedings relative to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or other obligor upon the Notes and the Hedge Agreements or to the creditors or property of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or such other obligor; (b) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders of the Notes, upon the direction of such Holders, in any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency Proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable Proceedings; and (c) to collect and receive any Monies or other property payable to or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Noteholders and of the Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders and the Trustee; and any trustee, receiver or liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Noteholders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other reasonable expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as a result of negligence or bad faith.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder, any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such Proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person.
All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other Proceedings relative thereto, and any action or Proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the reasonable expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each predecessor trustee and their respective agents and attorneys and counsel, shall be for the benefit of the Secured Parties and payable to the Secured Parties in accordance with the Priority of Payments.
In any Proceedings brought by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders, the Trustee shall be held to represent, subject to Section 6.17, all the Secured Parties.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, the Trustee may not sell or liquidate the Collateral or institute Proceedings in furtherance thereof pursuant to this Section 5.3 except in accordance with Section 5.5(a).
Section 5.4.
Remedies (a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and the Notes have been declared due and payable and such declaration and its consequences have not been 97
rescinded and annulled, the Co-Issuers agree that the Trustee may after notice to the Noteholders, the Collateral Manager, the Hedge Counterparty, the Preferred Share Paying Agent and each Rating Agency, and shall, upon direction by a Majority of the Controlling Class, to the extent permitted by applicable law, exercise one or more of the following rights, privileges and remedies: (i) institute Proceedings for the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes or otherwise payable under this Indenture, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect from the Collateral any Monies adjudged due; (ii) sell all or a portion of the Collateral or rights of interest therein at one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any manner permitted by law and in accordance with Section 5.17; (iii) institute Proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Collateral; (iv) exercise any remedies of a secured party under the UCC and take any other appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Secured Parties hereunder; and (v) exercise any other rights and remedies that may be available at law or in equity; provided, that the Trustee may not sell or liquidate the Collateral or institute Proceedings in furtherance thereof pursuant to this Section 5.4 except in accordance with Section 5.5(a).
The Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of any action proposed to be taken in accordance with this Section 5.4 and as to the sufficiency of the proceeds and other amounts receivable with respect to the Collateral to make the required payments of principal of and interest and the Commitment Fee on the Notes, which opinion shall be conclusive evidence as to such feasibility or sufficiency.
(b) If an Event of Default as described in Section 5.1(e) shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may, and at the request of the Holders of not less than 25% of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of the Controlling Class or the Hedge Counterparty shall, institute a Proceeding solely to compel performance of the covenant or agreement or to cure the representation or warranty, the breach of which gave rise to the Event of Default under such Section, and enforce any equitable decree or order arising from such proceeding.
(c) Upon any sale, whether made under the power of sale hereby given or by virtue of judicial proceedings, any Noteholder or Noteholders may bid for and purchase the Collateral or any part thereof and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain, possess or dispose of such property in its or their own absolute right without accountability.
Upon any sale, whether made under the power of sale hereby given or by virtue of judicial proceedings, the receipt of the Trustee, or of the Officer making a sale under judicial 98
proceedings, shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers at any sale for its or their purchase Money, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obliged to see to the application thereof.
Any such sale, whether under any power of sale hereby given or by virtue of judicial proceedings, shall bind the Co-Issuers, the Trustee, the Hedge Counterparty and the Noteholders, shall operate to divest all right, title and interest whatsoever, either at law or in equity, of each of them in and to the property sold, and shall be a perpetual bar, both at law and in equity, against each of them and their successors and assigns, and against any and all Persons claiming through or under them.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee may not, prior to the date which is one year and one day, or if longer the applicable preference period then in effect, after the payment in full of all Notes, institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, the Issuer or the Co-Issuer any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, moratorium or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under federal or state bankruptcy or similar laws or the laws of any jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall preclude, or be deemed to stop, the Trustee (i) from taking any action prior to the expiration of the aforementioned one year and one day period, or if longer the applicable preference period then in effect, in (A) any case or proceeding voluntarily filed or commenced by the Issuer or the Co-Issuer or (B) any involuntary insolvency proceeding filed or commenced by a Person other than the Trustee or (ii) from commencing against the Issuer or the Co-Issuer or any of its properties any legal action which is not a bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, moratorium, liquidation or similar proceeding.
Section 5.5.
Preservation of Collateral (a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing when any Class of Notes is Outstanding (and the Commitment Period Termination Date has not occurred), the Trustee shall retain the Collateral securing the Notes intact, collect and cause the collection of the proceeds thereof and make and apply all payments and deposits and maintain all accounts in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes in accordance with the Priority of Payments and the provisions of Sections 10, 12 and 13 unless: (i) the Trustee determines that the anticipated proceeds of a sale or liquidation of the Collateral (after deducting the reasonable expenses of such sale or liquidation) would be sufficient to discharge in full the amounts then due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, interest (including Class C Deferred Interest, Class D Deferred Interest, Class E Deferred Interest, Defaulted Interest and interest on Defaulted Interest, if any), Commitment Fee due and unpaid administrative expenses as limited by clause (2) of Section 11.1(a)(i) and any accrued and unpaid Hedge Payment Amounts payable by the Issuer pursuant to the Hedge Agreements, including termination payments (assuming, for this purpose, that each Hedge Agreement has been terminated by reason of an event of default or termination with respect to the Issuer); or 99
(ii) if the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in Aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of each Class of Notes voting as a separate Class direct, subject to the provisions hereof, the sale and liquidation of the Collateral.
(b) Nothing contained in Section 5.5(a) shall be construed to require the Trustee to preserve the Collateral securing the Notes if prohibited by applicable law.
For the purposes of making the determinations required pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(i), the Trustee shall apply the standards set forth in Section 9.1(b).
In addition, for the purposes of determining issues relating to the execution of a sale or liquidation of the Pledged Securities and the execution of a sale or other liquidation thereof in connection with a determination whether the condition specified in Section 5.5(a)(i) exists, the Trustee may retain and rely on an opinion of an Independent investment banking firm of national reputation.
The Trustee shall make the determinations required by Section 5.5(a)(i) within 30 days after an Event of Default and at the request of a Majority of the Controlling Class at any time during which the Trustee retains the Collateral pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(i).
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite Aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of any Class of Notes have given any direction or notice or have agreed pursuant to Section 5.5(a), any Holder of a Note of a Class who is also a Holder of Notes of another Class or any Affiliate of any such Holder shall be counted as a Holder of each such Note for all purposes.
(d) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at a time when no Note is Outstanding (and the Commitment Period Termination Date has occurred), the Trustee shall retain the Collateral securing the Notes intact, collect and cause the collection of the proceeds thereof and make and apply all payments and deposits and maintain all accounts in respect of the Collateral and the Notes in accordance with the Priority of Payments and the 100
provisions of Section 10 and Section 12 unless a Majority-in-Interest of Preferred Shareholders direct the sale and liquidation of the Collateral.

101
If the Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or more groups of Holders of the Controlling Class, each representing less than a Majority of the Controlling Class, the Trustee shall follow the instructions of the group representing the higher percentage of interest in the Controlling Class, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture.
Section 5.9.
Unconditional Rights of Noteholders to Receive Principal, Interest and the Commitment Fee Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture (other than Section 2.6(i)), the Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest and the Commitment Fee on such Note as such principal and interest and the Commitment Fee become due and payable in accordance with Section 13.1 and the Priority of Payments and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.8, to institute proceedings for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Section 5.10.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies If the Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and in every such case the Co-Issuers, the Trustee and the Noteholder shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Secured Parties shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been instituted.
Section 5.11.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Noteholders or Hedge Counterparty is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing by law or in equity or otherwise.
The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 5.12.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Noteholder or Hedge Counterparty to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.
Every right and remedy given by this Section 5 or by law to the Trustee or to the Noteholders or Hedge Counterparty may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Noteholders or Hedge Counterparty, as the case may be.
102

In the case of any such waiver, (i) the Co-Issuers, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereto and (ii) the Trustee shall promptly give written notice of any such waiver to the Collateral Manager, the Preferred Share Paying Agent and each Holder of Notes.
103
Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
Section 5.15.
Undertaking for Costs All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Note by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 5.15 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee or any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in Aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of the Controlling Class, or to any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest or the Commitment Fee on any Note on or after the Stated Maturity expressed in such Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the applicable Redemption Date).

(b) In case an Event of Default known to the Trustee has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall, prior to the receipt of directions, if any, from a Majority of the Controlling Class, exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs.
(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) this subclause (c) shall not be construed to limit the effect of subclause (a) of this Section 6.1; (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer, unless it shall be proven that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Collateral Manager in accordance with this Indenture, or a Majority (or such other percentage as may be required by the terms hereof) of the Controlling Class (or other Class if required or permitted by the terms hereof) relating to the time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture; (iv) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers contemplated hereunder, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it (if the amount of 106
such funds or risk or liability does not exceed the amount payable to the Trustee pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i)(2) net of the amounts specified in Section 6.8(a)(i), the Trustee shall be deemed to be reasonably assured of such repayment) unless such risk or liability relates to performance of its ordinary non-remedial services, including under Section 5, under this Indenture; and (v) the Trustee shall not be liable to the Noteholders for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith at the direction of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Collateral Manager or the Holders of the Notes under the circumstances in which such direction is required or permitted by the terms of this Indenture.

(e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 6.

The Trustee is hereby authorized to join in the execution of any such supplemental indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture that affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties, liabilities or indemnities under this Indenture or otherwise, except to the extent required by law.
If any Class of Notes is then rated by any Rating Agency, the Trustee shall not enter into any such supplemental indenture if, as a result of such supplemental indenture, the Rating Condition would not be satisfied with respect to such supplemental indenture, unless each Holder of Notes of each Class whose rating will be reduced or withdrawn has, after notice that the proposed supplemental indenture would result in such reduction or withdrawal of the rating of the Class of Notes held by such Holder, consented to such supplemental indenture.
The Trustee shall not enter into any such supplemental indenture if, as a result of such supplemental indenture, the interests of any Holder, Preferred Shareholder or Hedge Counterparty would be materially adversely affected thereby.
Unless notified by a Majority of any Class of Notes, a Majority-in-Interest of Preferred Shareholders or the Hedge Counterparty that such Class of Notes, the Preferred Shares or the Hedge Counterparty, as the case may be, will be materially adversely affected, the Trustee may, consistent with the written advice of counsel, determine whether or not such Class of Notes, the Preferred Shares or the Hedge Counterparty would be materially adversely affected by such change (after giving notice 140
of such change to each Noteholder, Preferred Shareholder and the Hedge Counterparty).
Such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all present and future Holders, Preferred Shareholders and the Hedge Counterparty.
The Trustee shall not be liable for any such determination made in good faith and in reliance in good faith upon an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Trustee as described in Section 8.3.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Noteholders or any consent of Preferred Shareholders or Hedge Counterparty under this Section 8.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act or consent shall approve the substance thereof.
Any failure of the Trustee to publish or mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

Person must be made pursuant to Rule 144A or another exemption from the registration requirements under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, solely to a purchaser that is both a Qualified Institutional Buyer and a Qualified Purchaser.

transfer, no further payments will be made in respect of such Note held by such beneficial owner.

Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Collateral Manager may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such Authorized Officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.
Any such certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Collateral Manager or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an Authorized Officer of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Collateral Manager or any other Person, stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Collateral Manager or such other Person, unless such Authorized Officer of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Collateral Manager or such counsel knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

Such reports and notices will be deemed to have been given on the date of such mailing.
In addition, for so long as any Class of Notes is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and so long as the rules of such exchange so require, notices to the Holders of such Notes shall also be given by delivery to the Company Announcements Office of the Irish Stock Exchange.
Neither the failure to mail any notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Note shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Notes.
Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In the event that, by reason of the suspension of the regular mail service as a result of a strike, work stoppage or similar activity, it shall be impractical to mail notice of any event to Noteholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

Section 14.10.
Submission to Jurisdiction Each of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and the Trustee hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Notes or this Indenture, and the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and Trustee each hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or federal court.
Each of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and the Trustee hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent that they may legally do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding.
Each of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any action or proceeding by the mailing or delivery of copies of such process to it at the office of the Co-Issuers’ agent in New York set forth in Section 7.2.

Section 14.12.
Judgment Currency This is an international financing transaction in which the specification of Dollars (the “Specified Currency”), and the specification of the place of payment, as the case may be (the “Specified Place”), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to payments of or on the Notes.
The payment obligations of the Co-Issuers under this Indenture and the Notes shall not be discharged by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place.
If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or the Notes in the Specified Currency into another currency (the “Second Currency”), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding that on which such judgment is rendered.
The obligation of the Co-Issuers in respect of any such sum due from the Co-Issuers hereunder shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged 183
only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Trustee of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder or under the Notes in the Second Currency the Trustee may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Co-Issuers hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment (but subject to the Priority of Payments as if such separate obligation in respect of each Class of Notes constituted additional principal owing in respect of such Class of Notes), agree to indemnify the Trustee and each Noteholder against, and to pay the Trustee or such Noteholder, as the case may be, on demand in the Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to the Trustee or such Noteholder, as the case may be, in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred.
Section 14.13.

The Collateral Manager will perform its obligations with respect to any such conflict in accordance with the Collateral Management Agreement and with the care, skill, prudence and diligence that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the resolution of such conflict; and (g) the Collateral Manager irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Notes or this Indenture, and the Collateral Manager irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or federal court.

(c) Each Hedge Agreement shall provide that, in respect of any Hedge Counterparty or transferee: (i) if the Hedge Rating Determining Party ceases to satisfy the Hedge Counterparty Ratings Requirement, then such Hedge Counterparty shall, within the period specified in the Hedge Agreement following such ratings downgrade (solely at the expense of the Hedge Counterparty), post collateral pursuant to the Credit Support Annex to the related Hedge Agreement, or obtain a guarantee or make an assignment to a replacement Hedge Counterparty or take such other action which satisfies the Rating Condition; and (ii) if its Hedge Rating Determining Party fails to satisfy the Ratings Threshold, then the Hedge Counterparty shall within ten Business Days of the occurrence of a Ratings Event (as defined in the related Hedge Agreement) either (x) assign its rights and obligations in and under the related Hedge Agreement (at its own expense) to another Hedge Counterparty that has ratings at least equal to the Hedge Counterparty Ratings Requirement or (y) enter into any other agreement with or arrangement for the benefit of the Issuer and the Trustee that is reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and that satisfies the Rating Condition.

(h) In the event that amounts are applied to the redemption of Notes on any Distribution Date in accordance with the Priority of Payments by reason of a failure to satisfy any of the Coverage Tests, then, subject to the satisfaction of the Rating Condition, the floating-fixed rate interest swaps under the Hedge Agreements will be subject to partial termination on such Distribution Date with respect to a portion of the notional amount thereof equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Notes so redeemed on such Distribution Date.
In addition, subject to the satisfaction of the Rating Condition with respect to such reduction, the Collateral Manager and a Majority-in-Interest of Preferred Shareholders (acting together) may on any Distribution Date direct the Issuer to reduce the notional amount of any interest rate swap or cap outstanding under any Hedge Agreement.

SCHEDULE A SCHEDULE OF COLLATERAL DEBT SECURITIES This schedule omits the names of the issuers of the collateral and identifies such issuers only by assigned numbers.
SCHEDULE B LIBOR FORMULA With respect to each Interest Period, “LIBOR” for purposes of calculating the Note Interest Rate for the Notes for such Interest Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions: (i) On the second LIBOR Business Day (provided, that, on such day commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in foreign currency deposits) in London (a “LIBOR Banking Day”), and otherwise the next preceding LIBOR Business Day that is also a LIBOR Banking Day), prior to each February 5, May 5, August 5 and November 5 and, with respect to the Class A-1 Notes only, Borrowing Date (each such day, a “LIBOR Determination Date”), LIBOR shall equal the rate, as obtained by the Calculation Agent, for U.S. Dollar deposits in Europe of the Designated Maturity which appears on Telerate (as defined in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 2000 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Definitions) Page 3750 or such other page as may replace such Page 3750, as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such LIBOR Determination Date, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets Commodities News or any successor service (“Telerate Page 3750”).
“LIBOR Business Day” means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banking institutions in New York, New York, or Wilmington, Delaware are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to be closed.
If, on such LIBOR Determination Date, at least two of the Reference Banks provide such quotations, LIBOR shall equal the arithmetic mean of such quotations.
If, on such LIBOR Determination Date, only one or none of the Reference Banks provides such a quotation, LIBOR shall be deemed to be the arithmetic mean of the offered quotations that at least two leading banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting on such LIBOR Determination Date for U.S. Dollar deposits in Europe of the Designated Maturity at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) in an amount determined by the Calculation Agent; provided, that if the Calculation Agent is required but is unable to determine LIBOR in accordance with at least one of the procedures provided above, LIBOR shall be LIBOR in effect for the immediately preceding Interest Period.
As used herein, “Reference Banks” means four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent.
(iii) In respect of any Interest Period having a Designated Maturity other than one, two, three or six months, LIBOR shall be determined through the use of straight line interpolation by reference to two rates calculated in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) above, one of which shall be determined as if the maturity of the Dollar deposits referred B-1
to therein were the period of time for which rates are available next shorter than the Interest Period and the other of which shall be determined as if the such maturity were the period of time for which rates are available next longer than the Interest Period; provided, that, if an Interest Period is less than or equal to seven days, then LIBOR shall be determined by reference to a rate calculated in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) above as if the maturity of the Dollar deposits referred to therein were a period of time equal to seven days.
For so long as any floating rate Note remains outstanding, the Issuer will at all times maintain an agent appointed to calculate LIBOR in respect of each Interest Period.
B-2
Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.
The following procedures shall be subject to the terms of Section 9.5(ii).

(a) Subject to Section 9.5(ii), the Collateral Manager will be allowed to bid in the Auction if it deems appropriate, but will not be required to do so.
Such deposit will not be invested.
