(iii)     If all or any portion of the Property located at the Luverne Facility is subject to a Casualty Event, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Net Cash Proceeds from such Casualty Event are received, the Company shall make a written offer to each Holder (by delivering such offer to the Trustee who shall at the expense of the Company (x) promptly deliver such offer to each Holder and (y) thereafter notify the Company when the Trustee has delivered such notice to the Holders) to apply an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds to redeem the Obligations, if any are then outstanding, in accordance with Section 3.14(e) and Section 3.14(f) below, and each Holder shall have thirty (30) days after it receives such written offer from the Company (or the Trustee, as applicable) to determine whether to accept its Pro Rata Share of such redemption offer (failure to respond within such thirty (30) day period shall be construed as acceptance of such redemption offer by such Holder); provided that no such redemption (or offer to redeem Obligations) shall be required under this Section 3.14(c)(iii) with respect to such Casualty Events which do not exceed, in the aggregate, a fair market value of $5,000,000 through the Maturity Date.
(iv)     Each written offer to redeem the Obligations delivered to Holders in accordance with Section 3.14(c) shall specify the section of this Indenture pursuant to which the redemption shall occur, the proposed redemption date, the Principal Amount of the Obligations to be redeemed and the amount of accrued interest and Mandatory Redemption Make-Whole Payment due in connection therewith.
(v)     Without limiting or otherwise modifying the perfection requirements with respect to Deposit Accounts (as defined in the Security Agreement) set forth in the Security Agreement, promptly upon delivering notice to the Trustee (or by filing materials with the Commission stating the Company’s intention and contemporaneously delivering such materials to the Trustee and each Holder) stating its intention to invest or reinvest the Net Cash Proceeds from a Casualty Event, all of such Net Cash Proceeds to be invested or reinvested pursuant Section 3.14(c) shall be remitted to a Deposit Account that constitutes a Collateral Account until such amounts are so invested or reinvested.
(vi)     All offers to redeem the Obligations under this Section 3.14(c) shall be made on a pro rata basis based upon each Holder’s Pro Rata Share (with respect to Global Notes, such offers will be made pursuant to the Applicable Procedures that most nearly approximate a pro rata selection).
(b)     A redemption called by the Company pursuant to this Section 3.15 shall occur on the date (the “Redemption Date”) of the 120th calendar day (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) following the date on which the Trustee shall have sent the corresponding Notice of Redemption as provided below; provided, however, that in no event shall a Notice of Redemption be sent prior to the first Business Day following the day on which the Stockholder Approval has been obtained.
(c)     To call any Notes for redemption, the Trustee (acting upon written request from the Company and at the Company’s expense) shall send or cause to be sent to each Holder, at its last address as the same appears on the Register (in the case of Physical Notes) or in compliance with Applicable Procedures (in the case of Global Notes), a notice of such Redemption prepared by the Company (a “Notice of Redemption”).

The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of any deposits of cash made pursuant to this Section 3.15(f).
(g)     For the avoidance of doubt, any Notice of Redemption delivered to Holders in accordance with this Section 3.15 shall not impair the right of such Holders to convert the Notes prior to the applicable Redemption Date subject to the following:
(i)     From time to time prior to the Redemption Date, a Holder may notify to the Company in writing:
(A)     the Principal Amount of the Notes that such Holder may wish to convert into shares of Common Stock on a Trading Day, not later than five (5) Trading Days thencefrom, the date of which will be notified to the Company thereafter; and
(B)     prior to the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Trading Day on which a conversion is to occur (each such Trading Day, an “Alternate Conversion Date”), the Principal Amount of the Notes that the Holder will surrender for conversion into shares of Common Stock on such Alternate Conversion Date.
(ii)     Upon receipt of such second notification, the Company will be required, on the designated Alternate Conversion Date, to convert the Principal Amount of Notes specified therein into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Price; provided, however, that in no event will the Company be required to convert into shares of Common Stock more than the Principal Amount of Notes specified in the notice provided pursuant to clause (g)(i)(A) above (such notice, a “Notice of Intent”); and provided, further, that any Alternate Conversion Date designated in a notice provided pursuant to clause (g)(i)(B) above must not fall beyond the five (5) Trading Days set forth in the corresponding Notice of Intent or past the Redemption Date.
Delivery of such shares of Common Stock shall be made in the same manner as the delivery of shares in settlement of the conversion obligation under Article 7.
If the Company elects or is required to pay the Alternate Conversion Make-Whole Payment in cash, the Company shall, prior to 11:00 a.m. local time in The City of New York, on the relevant Alternate Conversion Date, deposit with the Paying Agent immediately available funds sufficient to pay such Alternate Conversion Make-Whole Payment, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.

The Company shall, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on the Notes, deposit with the Paying Agent a sum (in funds which are immediately available on the due date for such payment) sufficient to pay such principal or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action; provided, however, that if such deposit is made on the due date, such deposit shall be received by the Paying Agent by 11:00 a.m. New York City time, on such date.
(b)     If the Company shall act as its own Paying Agent, it will, by 11:00 a.m. New York City time on each due date of the principal of or interest on the Notes, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due and will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action and of any failure by the Company (or any other obligor under the Notes) to make any payment of the principal of or interest on the Notes when the same shall become due and payable.
(b)     The Credit Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for all of such insurance (and the corresponding insurance certificates) to provide that no cancellation, material reduction in amount or material change in coverage thereof shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days after receipt by the Collateral Trustee of written notice thereof (except with respect to cancellation as a result of a payment default, such cancellation shall not be effective until at least ten (10) days after receipt by the Collateral Trustee of written notice thereof) and if an endorsement providing such notice is commercially impracticable by any Credit Party’s carrier (or such carrier(s) otherwise refuse to deliver such notice), such Credit Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide thirty (30) days or ten (10) days, as applicable, notice to the Collateral Trustee prior to the cancellation, material reduction in amount or material change in coverage.

then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Company’s Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 9.13, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note or Notes for at least six (6) months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee; provided, however, that if no successor Trustee shall have been appointed and have accepted appointment sixty (60) days after either the Company or the Holders has removed the Trustee, the Trustee so removed may petition at its own expense any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor trustee.
Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 11.11 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amount then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.07, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act.
Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers.
Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section 11.12, the Company (or the former trustee, at the written direction of the Company) shall mail or cause to be mailed notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder to the Holders of Notes at their addresses as they shall appear on the Register.
If the Company fails to mail such notice within ten (10) days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Company.
In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee or authenticating agent appointed by such predecessor trustee, and deliver such Notes so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee or any authenticating agent appointed by such successor trustee may authenticate such Notes in the name of the successor trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force that is provided in the Notes or in this Indenture; provided, however, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or authenticate Notes in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than three (3) Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Trustee shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee:
(i)     quarterly, not more than fifteen (15) days after each Regular Record Date, a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Holders as of such Regular Record Date; and
(ii)     at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than fifteen (15) days prior to the time such list is furnished;
The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 12.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
Within sixty (60) days after each January 15 beginning with the January 15 following the date of this Indenture, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders of the Notes a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with Trust Indenture Act § 313(a) (but if no event described in Trust Indenture Act § 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted).
The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by Trust Indenture Act § 313(c).
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of Notes shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the Commission and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Notes are listed in accordance with Trust Indenture Act § 313(d).
The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on or de-listed from any stock exchange.
(a)     When (a) the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Notes theretofore authenticated (other than any Notes that have been destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for which other Notes shall have been authenticated and delivered) and not theretofore canceled, or (b) all the Notes not theretofore canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation shall have become due and payable, and the Company shall deposit with the Trustee, in trust, cash or shares of Common Stock (in the case of any conversion) sufficient to pay on the Maturity Date, upon any Fundamental Change Date or upon any conversion (other than any Notes that shall have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for which other Notes shall have been authenticated and delivered) not theretofore canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal and interest or shares of Common Stock (in the case of any conversion) due to such Maturity Date, Fundamental Change Purchase Date or upon conversion, as the case may be, accompanied by a verification report, as to the sufficiency of the deposited amount, from an independent certified accountant or other financial professional satisfactory to the Trustee, and if the Company shall also pay or deliver or cause to be paid or delivered all other sums payable or deliverable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to (i) remaining rights of registration of transfer, substitution and exchange and conversion of Notes, (ii) rights hereunder of Holders to receive payments of principal of and interest or (in the case of any conversion) shares of Common Stock on, the Notes and the other rights, duties and obligations of Holders, as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the amounts, if any, so deposited with the Trustee and (iii) the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee hereunder), and the Trustee, on written demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as required by Section 1.02 and at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging this Indenture; the Company, however, hereby agrees to the Trustee for any costs or expenses thereafter reasonably and properly incurred by the Trustee and to compensate the Trustee for any services thereafter reasonably and properly rendered by the Trustee in connection with this Indenture or the Notes.
The Company shall cause notice of the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 14.02 to be mailed to each Holder, at such Holder’s address appearing on the Register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof.
