Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, the Company agrees to sell to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the applicable purchase prices set forth in Schedule I hereto, the respective principal amounts of the Underwritten Certificates set forth opposite the name of each Underwriter set forth in Schedule II hereto, and any additional portions of the Underwritten Certificates that any such Underwriter may be obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 10, in all cases plus accrued interest as set forth in Schedule I.
If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Underwritten Certificates agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally (in the respective proportions which the portion of the Underwritten Certificates set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Underwritten Certificates set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) to purchase the Underwritten Certificates that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, that no Underwriter shall be obligated under this Section 10 to purchase Certificates of a Class that it is not otherwise obligated to purchase under this Agreement, and provided, however, that in the event that the amount of Underwritten Certificates that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Certificates set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Underwritten Certificates, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of the Underwritten Certificates, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 11 or Section 12.
