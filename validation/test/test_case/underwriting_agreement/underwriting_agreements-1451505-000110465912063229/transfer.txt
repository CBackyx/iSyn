(c)           The Issuers agree that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Issuers will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document that will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Issuers by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.

(k)           The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of all of their respective obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (h) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability (x) that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection or (y) to the extent that the indemnifying party does not suffer actual prejudice as a result of such failure.
If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Issuers shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms.
